This is a short blog post explaining the basics of Distill.\r\nhttps://github.com/laderast/distill_website/\r\nWorkshop Video\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nLearn the basic components of a distill website\r\nBuild and preview your website using the Build tab\r\nCustomize the website with your bio and your picture\r\nAdd links and entries to your Navbar Menu\r\nAdd knitted html files as article links\r\nGet your website live using Netlify Drop\r\nUpdate your website by claiming it and registering it\r\nChange your domain name to a better one.\r\nBefore You Start\r\nInstall R/RStudio Desktop to your Computer.\r\nInstall the following packages in R:\r\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"postcards\", \"distill\", \"usethis\"))\r\nCreate a website project in your home directory using usethis.\r\nusethis::use_course(url=\"laderast/distill_website\",destdir=\".\")\r\nTake a look at the website before we get started:\r\nhttps://distill-example.netlify.app/\r\nGather up the follwing materials:\r\nLinks to Social Media (twitter, linkedin, etc)\r\nBio\r\nHeadshot\r\nKnitted .html files you want to share\r\nSign up for a netlify account and log in: https://netlify.com\r\nTaking a tour of the Project\r\nThese are the main files for the project.\r\nindex.Rmd - This is the main website page.\r\nabout.Rmd - This is a nice looking about page built using the {postcards} package.\r\nimage - A folder. Any images you put in here can be accessed by image/ted.jpg in your pages.\r\narticles/ - A folder. This is a nice place to park your articles. For right now, it’s probably easier to have self-contained articles (single html files)\r\n_site.yml - Customize this to change menus and links\r\n_site/ folder - this contains your rendered website - you’ll drop this folder into Netlify Drop and it will serve it.\r\ntheme.css - this is where you can set appearance options, such as font, font-size, and colors.\r\nHow does {distill} work?\r\n{distill} is what is called a static site generator. It takes Markdown and Rmarkdown and converts them to . .html files.\r\nMuch like any RMarkdown file, {distill} uses {knitr} and pandoc to build your website files that are contained in an RStudio Project. It knits your .Rmd files, converting them to .html files to a folder. The default name of this folder is called _site and it contains all of them files you need to upload to make a website.\r\nWhat is Netlify?\r\nNetlify is what is called a hosting service. This is a network of computers called web servers that are accessible via web addresses that will serve your website files when they are requested by a web browser.\r\nThe amazing thing about Netlify is that it is mostly free and it is very fast, no matter where you are (they have web servers almost everywhere).\r\nWe’ll use Netlify Drop to get our website files up and accessible as quickly as possible.\r\nCustomize your about links\r\nTake a look at about.Rmd and start filling out the front matter with your own links:\r\nlinks:\r\n  - label: LinkedIn\r\n    url: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-laderas-0714a92/\"\r\n  - label: Twitter\r\n    url: \"https://twitter.com/tladeras\"\r\n  - label: Portfolio\r\n    url: \"index.html\"\r\n  - label: Email\r\n    url: \"mailto:email@email.com\"\r\nAdding a photo\r\nAdd your photo to the images folder. Change the line in about.Rmd:\r\nimage: \"image/ted.jpg\"\r\nto the name of your file. For example, if your file is named jane.jpg and you put it in images:\r\nimage: \"image/jane.jpg\"\r\nBuilding your website using the Build Tab\r\nIn the top right panel in RStudio (next to Environment and History), there is a “Build” Tab.\r\nPress the Build Website to run knitr, which will knit your website to the _site folder. This is where your rendered content lives.\r\nBuild Website TabPreviewing your website\r\nOpen the _site folder and click on the index.html file (make sure you’re viewing in web browser)\r\nThis is your main link to the website (the entry point). For example, if I was hosting my website at https://laderast.github.io/, this would be the first page that I would see.\r\n\r\nYour about page is available as about.html in the _site folder.\r\nClick away and make sure that everything works (links in menu, etc). If not, update the _site.yml and build it again.\r\nTry out different postcards themes\r\nThe postcards package has the following built in themes:\r\njolla\r\njolla_blue\r\nonofre\r\ntrestles - which your current site uses\r\nChange this line in your about.Rmd file to the theme of your interest and start building again:\r\noutput:\r\n  postcards::trestles\r\nAdd Your Rendered .html files to the articles/ folder\r\nYou can now add your articles to the articles/ folder.\r\nThere are a couple example articles here. Add your own files here.\r\nIn general, you’ll put knitted html articles here. Distill does not rebuild articles, it leaves that up to you.\r\nThe relative path to access articles is like this:\r\narticles/crops.html\r\nYou’ll use this when adding links to your menu.\r\nCustomize the Menu\r\nThe menu lives in the _site.yml file:\r\nnavbar:\r\n  right:\r\n    - text: \"Home\"\r\n      href: index.html\r\n    - text: \"About\"\r\n      href: about.html\r\n    - text: \"Articles\"\r\n      menu:\r\n          -  text: \"dplyr::slice()\"\r\n             href: articles/slice.html\r\n          -  text: \"Crop Yields\"\r\n             href: articles/crops.html\r\nAdd another menu entry under articles, or modify the above entries to have a link to your articles.\r\nBuild your website again and preview it to make sure the links work.\r\nGetting Your Website Online\r\nWe’ll take the _site folder with our generated website and drop this entire folder into Netlify Drop.\r\nhttps://drop.netlify.com\r\n\r\nUpdating Your Website\r\nThe first thing you want to do is claim your site and register for a Netlify account. That ties your newly created website to your account so you can update it.\r\nWhen you update your website with the Build Website button, you’ll drag the _site folder onto the deploy zone. This is under the deploy tab:\r\n\r\n\r\nMore info here: https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#drag-and-drop\r\nCustomize Your Domain\r\nThat crazy name is the address of your site. To change it, you can click on the Domain Settings button:\r\nDomain Settings ButtonIn the following page, click the Options >> Edit Site Name button. You can change the first part of the domain, such as \"myportfolio.netlify.app).\r\nEdit Site Name ButtonStyling your website\r\nNote that this only applies to the main distill website and not the about.html, since that is styled separately.\r\nIn _site.yml, try uncommenting this line and seeing how the site changes.\r\n#theme: theme.css\r\nYou can modify the appearance of your website by altering the theme.css file. Much more info about this here:\r\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html#theming\r\nCreating New Websites\r\nIf you want to start from scratch, I highly recommend the Distill tutorial here:\r\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html\r\nYou may want to setup your webpage as a blog, which lets you add posts by date:\r\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog.html\r\nPutting your site code on GitHub\r\nThis is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can put your site code up on GitHub as well. This has the following advantages:\r\nLets others contribute to your website\r\nCan host on GitHub Pages as well\r\nLets others reuse your code for their own website\r\nIf you’re interested in this, I really recommend Happy Git with R as a way to get started.\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nThank you to RStudio for the {distill} package. It is so great!\r\nPortions of this tutorial are adapted from: https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html and from https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/sharing-on-short-notice-how-to-get-your-materials-online-with-r-markdown/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
