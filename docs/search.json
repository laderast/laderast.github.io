I believe that research should not be lonely, and building communities of practice in science and research that are psychologically safe and inclusive are the key to doing better, more robust science. To this end, I use evidence based pedagogy, especially utilizing the concepts of psychological safety and active learning. I am a certified instructor for both The Carpentries and RStudio.\r\n            My free Ready for R course currently is at over 1300 external users, and I have built a learning community around it. The course has been lauded by users as being inclusive and less intimidating than other R courses.
