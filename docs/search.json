    "text": "Ted Laderas\n\n\n2022 was a fairly busy year for me, not just with Academy engagements, but also in outreach and working on improving the user experience with effective workshops, courses, and developing optimal workflows for getting the main tasks on the platform done. \n\nI’ve achieved this by observing user experiences and questions from the UKB RAP community, and from questions customers have asked during training sessions.\n\n\n\nOne of my major passions in my work is to improve the overall user experience of the DNAnexus platform by establishing and suggesting effective workflows and best practices for getting tasks accomplished on the platform. These tasks include: executing batch jobs on the platform, working with RStudio Effectively on RAP, working with Docker, decoding pheno data from raw values, and using bash effectively on RAP.\n\nEach of these accomplishments has stemmed from observing gaps in customer’s knowledge in the platform. I believe that one of the biggest barriers to using the platform is still the feeling of impostor syndrome and I am passionate about giving customers the knowledge they need in formats that are helpful for them.\n\n\n104 - Cloud Computing for HPC Users. This was a course and webinar that I developed with Anastazie Sedlakova and Scott Funkhouser. It attempts to directly map skills and concepts that incoming users already have with on-premise HPC and directly translates these skills to cloud HPC. It has been rated highly by both UKB RAP users and other customers.  \n312 - JSON for the DNAnexus Platform - This is a course that I developed that fills in a lot of the gaps with utilizing JSON effectively on the DNAnexus platform. It helps users who are unfamiliar with JSON read and modify JSON for use in applets, but also in parsing JSON responses with the platform using jq, and doing batch submissions with jq.\nBash for Bioinformatics - In response to many of the challenges that I have seen with customers and app development and running jobs, I put together a “missing manual” that addresses the gaps in knowledge of bash scripting and where this knowledge is helpful on the platform. It has gotten positive reception not only on the UKB RAP community, but also by Solution Science as a resource they can point potential customers to.  \nRStudio for RAP webinar - With Anastazie Sedlakova, I developed a webinar that outlined how to work reproducibly with RStudio on UKB RAP. This involved not only showing users how to use RStudio Projects, but also how to save software environments for reproducible research, and run RStudio/Bioconductor via Docker containers. \nDocker for RAP webinar - This was a webinar that I developed with Ondrej Klempir on how to effectively use Docker on UKB RAP for batch processing. It provides specific bash recipes for saving docker image files, extending docker images, and running batch jobs with Docker image files.\ndxhelper - this is an R Package I have developed to help R users with decoding Pheno data extracted from the new dx extract_dataset functionality in dx-toolkit. R users are a major percentage of UKB RAP users, and this package will helps them with their overall user experience with the pheno data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have helped onboard a number of our new employees through both Bootcamp and a formal set of courses. This was in direct response to Dick’s call for more internal training specifically for our sales team.\n\n\nOngoing training with Alex Edwards. Alex and I continue to cross-train each other on various features of the platform, including Apollo specific features. He’s now ready to train OFH alpha users on these features. I hope to learn more about the ingestion process next year.\nTrained 2 incoming groups on platform, including Apollo features. We have increased our overall training in our onboarding program, including incoming members of the Sales team. \n\n\n\nThis has included frank discussions and addressing questions the Sales team has about the product, and helping them develop the language to effectively communicate about the platform. \nI believe this has helped not only in increasing knowledge, but also communication between various groups at DNAnexus. \n\n\n\nGave Science Deep Dive talk on Teaching: Using Cognitive Science to Make Training Stick\nTalk for xVantage Day: Using Quarto: https://laderast.github.io/qmd_rmd/ \nTrained VN team on platform. As part of the Vietnam Team’s onboarding, we delivered the Titan/Apollo courses to them.\nOutreach to other groups. I continue to work and communicate with members of Customer Care, Translational Medicine, Customer Success, UKB RAP, and Solution Science          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want others to effectively utilize the platform and accomplish work with it. To this end, I have helped with outreach to a number of new audiences with Ben Busby and the UKB RAP team. I \n\n\nRAP getting started workshops. I sat in on 5 sessions that were a combination of workshop and Q&A for new UKB RAP users. I was actively answering questions in the chat and providing links to material.\nHDR UK - I was part of a group of educators talking about TREs and their role in working with clinical data. Specifically I talked about the role of UKB RAP and how it fulfilled the requirements of a TRE (patient security) in spite of it being a cloud-based solution\nImaging Workshop - I helped Renee Qian with setup and running the MATLAB container on UKB RAP for the imaging workshop, including showing her how to use dxFUSE for her demo.\nISCB Academy - Ben and I presented various UKB RAP features as a workshop for ISCB Academy, and shared Bash for Bioinformatics as a resource for others.\nI developed and shared an R specific workflow for UKB RAP for exporting, decoding, and working with Pheno data using my dxhelper package. It was used for the in-person UKB RAP workshop this December.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Academy, we continue to innovate and deliver effective training through our use of active learning exercises and other modalities. \n\nOne of the ongoing challenges is training customers on the different versions of the platforms (OFH Alpha/Beta, Optum Clinico-Genomics, UKB RAP, and the GA platform). \n\nOne of our goals is to integrate new features as shared by product as quickly into course materials as possible. Sometimes the material provided by product needs improvement in terms of user experience, and we aim to deliver improved notebooks so we can better teach the respective topic.\n\nThis is a list of the courses that I have actively developed this year:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourses\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\n\n\nDescription of work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n103 Cloud computing for Scientists\n\n\n103 Cloud computing for Scientists (On Demand)\n\n\n103 Cloud computing for Scientists (RAP)\n\n\n\n\n\nCore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of webinar version (for RAP) \n\n\nDevelopment of on-demand course.

    "section": "Instructor Training",
    "text": "Instructor Training\nThe instructor training is online, but delivered via Zoom. The session themselves are 4 hours apiece and at set times, with a small cohort overall (I think mine was about 14). Greg Wilson delivered a short set of slides for each activity, and depending on the activity, we were sent out into smaller groups to discuss the topic. I liked how the course was paced - I felt like having activities almost every half hour definitely kept me awake.\nThe training for me (I am on PST) was from 8 AM to 12 PM two days in a row, and my cohort was from all over the US/Canada.\nHere are the parts of the instructor training that I found especially useful. Note that since Greg also helped develop the Carpentries instructor training, there is some overlap between the two training programs (in fact, if you’ve taught a Carpentries course and done the Carpentries training, you can waive the instructor training altogether).\nBuilding concept maps. If you can, you should map out the concepts you want to teach, along with how these concepts are related. This concept map is important in helping your students build the mental models that will guide them towards mastery. I did a concept map of Tidy data for my example. Concept maps themselves are a bit tricky to build, but I think they help clarify your understanding of what you are teaching, and thus your lessons will be more understandable.\nThinking about cognitive overload. This was a call to think about limiting the number of concepts and connections covered per unit. Humans have a short term memory of about 5 +/- 2 things at a time. This is an extremely helpful guideline to consider when developing training units, as your course objectives and training should keep these in mind. Also, there are different kinds of cognitive overload, and some of them (like extraneous details), you can remove to help with the other kinds. There are lots of ways to teach coding, such as Parsons Problems (where students have to put lines of code in order), or faded examples (fill in the blank style coding assignments), that can focus on particular aspects of coding. (As an unrelated topic, I have been thinking about reading code as being an essential skill and I try to teach students to learn how to read code.)\nTeaching needs to be dynamic. As instructors, part of our value lies in tailoring our training for our students and their previous knowledge. Unlike YouTube videos, we can assess what our students already know, and focus on the concepts that they don’t. In order to do this, though, we need to have ways of assessing what our students know. Formative assessments (assessments during a lesson) are essential in figuring out whether you can proceed, or whether you need to spend more time.\nProviding feedback. We were to teach each other a short lesson of our choosing, which was pretty fun. After a test run with a larger group, my partner and I got to teach each other - she taught me about making jam (and the food safety issues) and I taught her about making cornbread. (It was close to lunchtime when we did this, I think we were both hungry.) The exercise was super useful in helping us to not be afraid of giving feedback and to be aware of what kinds of feedback to give.\nWhat demotivates students. This was an important section, and a bit emotionally difficult. I have been guilty of some of the teaching behavior that demotivates students, such as taking over their keyboard, instead of letting them fix it. If we are to be inclusive and welcoming to everyone, we need to be aware of these (sometimes subtle) behaviors that can discourage and demotivate all of our students.\nOther tips from other instructors. I really enjoyed hearing other instructor’s experiences and I had a lot of respect for my cohort. There were lots of little tips we shared with each other that were super helpful, such as the types of mics to use. I also thought that it was helpful when we shared our struggles with each other. It made me feel much more as part of a group of instructors, which was very helpful for me."

This exam, like the others, was open book, open note, open internet, but not open person (no lifeline, no talking with others).\nAs part of the exam, we were required to develop and deliver a lesson. I ended up reworking one of my SQL lessons in my Analytics course. I found it a really useful exercise in rethinking my examples discussing left and inner joins, especially in my table examples. You can see my lesson here: SQL Joins in R.\nThis part of the exam is only about 10 minutes long, but you should be prepared, especially in figuring out how you will assess the learning of the students."

    "text": "Tidyverse Certification Exam\nAfter I had done my instructor certification, I had to do the technical qualifications. This was also done online, with Greg delivering the exam over Zoom. Most of the exam had to be done via RStudio on my computer. This exam, like the others, was open book, open note, open internet, but not open person (no lifeline, no talking with others).\nWhat did the exam cover? Roughly, it covered almost all of R for Data Science and was very task-focused. There was a focus on debugging, data transformation, markdown and visualization. The tasks were mostly problem driven, on the order of recreating a figure, or parametrizing a workflow. It was emphasized that we should solve the problems the way we usually work and talk out our problems aloud. For one of the problems, I actually had to search and teach myself on the fly. This was actually a good way to confirm that my conceptual models of the tidyverse were helpful.\nOne tip: 90 minutes is a long amount of time for an exam, especially where you are actively thinking and talking out loud. You should have something to eat by your side so you can replenish your blood glucose. It is also slightly unnerving to have someone watch you actively solve problems and program. If you get flustered, take a breath. There’s not usually a single way to solve the problems."

    "text": "Shiny Certification Exam\nA few weeks later, I took the Shiny certification. In terms of coverage, there is not currently a good text to study for the Shiny Certification exam (Mastering Shiny is probably going to be the reference to study when it is finished). In order to prepare, I went over the RStudio articles about Shiny, and looked over the RStudio Shiny Gallery to bone up on the different programming techniques used in Shiny, such as UI elements, reactives, the observe/update pattern, and modules.\nAgain, the exam covered debugging, including fixing applications, understanding control logic between ui and server, and building an app from scratch. I would say much of the exam covers how well established your own mental model of Shiny progamming is.\nOne thing to remember: as the technology and code changes, the certification exams will change and you may have to get re-certified. So my experience of these exams may be different than your experience."

How does R know which function from which package you’re talking about? One nightmare case is the Bioconductor exprs() method and the rlang exprs() function. These functions do very, very different things (one of them extracts an expression matrix from a Bioconductor ExpressionSet, and the other one is used for quoting multiple expressions).\nWhat happens when you call library on both of these packages? The worst case scenario is that you mean to call one package function and R executes the other one. This is called a namespace collision, and unfortunately it can break your code.\nEnter the namespace, which allows us to be package and function specific. If I want to use the function filter from dplyr, I write it as dplyr::filter. The dplyr:: part is the namespace of the dplyr package."

You can see a list of all of the packages that burro utilizes. In ye olde days of R, we used the Depends: field. Nowadays we use the Imports: fields. Here’s a Stack Overflow post explaining why. The main reason is that Imports: requires the package to have a namespace.\nModifying the DESCRIPTION file by hand is possible, but I don’t recommend it. Instead, you can use the usethis package to modify it. For example, if I want to use dplyr in my package I can do this in the console, while I am building it.\nusethis::use_package(\"dplyr\")\nThis will add dplyr to the Imports: field of your DESCRIPTION file.\nAddition (Thanks Hao Ye, for the suggestion): If the function is in a development version (i.e., hosted on GitHub), you can use usethis::use_dev_package() to add it to your DESCRIPTION file. It will add an additional field called Remotes: to your package:\n\nusethis::use_dev_package(\"tidyverse/dplyr\")\n\nFor more info about using remotes, check out the vignette: https://remotes.r-lib.org/articles/dependencies.html"

So, if you need to use multiple packages, @import one package and use @importsFrom or namespaces to refer to functions in the other packages."

    "text": "Exported versus Internal functions\nRemember I mentioned ‘@export’ above? Specifying in a docstring for your function exports it. Specifying it means that ‘devtools::document()’ will add an Export directive for the function in the NAMESPACE file. That means you can access it using ‘::’. Going back to our use_filter example:\n#' @export                              #This is where you add the @export\n#' @importFrom dplyr filter\nuse_filter &lt;- function(df, cutoff=0.5) {\n\n  filter(df, value &lt; cutoff)\n\n}\nIf our package name is mypackage, then this function will be accessible if we use library(mypackage) or mypackage::use_filter().\nWhy is this important? You may write some internal functions that are useful in your package, but they aren’t necessarily ones you want your users to use in their daily use. @export allows you to control which functions you make publicly accessible in your package.\nFor example, try typing dplyr:: in RStudio and hit the tab key. You’ll see the usual dplyr verbs pop up. But these are only the exported functions. Now try dplyr::: and hit the tab key. You’ll see a list of functions that pop up that’s much longer - these are all the functions, including the internal functions.\nSo, if there’s a cool bit of internal code you want to use in a package, you can use ‘:::’ to specify it. Just be aware that oftentimes, internal functions may change a lot as code gets refactored, so code that utilizes them may be refactored."

Use only 1 @import statement in a function, use namespaces/@importsFrom for the other packages.\nExpose functions you want to be made public using @export in your roxygen documentation.\nRemember to run devtools::document() in the console after you modify/add these fields to the roxygen documentation when you build for testing, or set it up in Tools &gt;&gt; Project Options.\n\nI hope this helps you to understand exactly the relationships between all of the components that are responsible for accessing namespaces in your package. I was confused about this for years, so writing this has helped me understand these relationships."

    "text": "Even though I’ve been using the tidyverse for a couple of years, there’s always a couple new applications of tidyverse verbs.\nThis one, in retrospect, is pretty simple. I had a one to many table that I wanted to collapse, tidy-style. Let’s look at the diamonds dataset:\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% select(color, cut) %&gt;%\n  head() %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\ncolor\ncut\n\n\n\n\nE\nIdeal\n\n\nE\nPremium\n\n\nE\nGood\n\n\nI\nPremium\n\n\nJ\nGood\n\n\nJ\nVery Good\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we wanted to collapse all the entries for each color into a single line? There’s 7 different colors, so we can use a combination of group_by on color and use the paste() function within summarize() to get what we want, which I’ve called all_colors here. By specifying the collapse argument, we can specify the delimiter within that column:\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% select(color, cut) %&gt;% \n  group_by(color) %&gt;% \n  summarize(all_colors=\n              paste(cut, collapse=\";\"))\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  color all_colors                                                              \n  &lt;ord&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                                                   \n1 D     Very Good;Very Good;Very Good;Good;Good;Premium;Premium;Ideal;Ideal;Ver…\n2 E     Ideal;Premium;Good;Fair;Premium;Premium;Very Good;Very Good;Very Good;G…\n3 F     Premium;Very Good;Very Good;Very Good;Good;Premium;Very Good;Very Good;…\n4 G     Very Good;Ideal;Ideal;Very Good;Premium;Premium;Ideal;Very Good;Ideal;P…\n5 H     Very Good;Very Good;Very Good;Good;Good;Very Good;Good;Very Good;Very G…\n6 I     Premium;Very Good;Ideal;Good;Premium;Ideal;Ideal;Ideal;Ideal;Very Good;…\n7 J     Good;Very Good;Good;Ideal;Ideal;Good;Good;Very Good;Very Good;Very Good…\n\n\nThanks to Ken Butler, who pointed out that the tidyverse way (via stringr) is to use str_c instead:\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% select(color, cut) %&gt;% \n  group_by(color) %&gt;% \n  summarize(all_colors=\n              stringr::str_c(cut, collapse=\";\")) \n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  color all_colors                                                              \n  &lt;ord&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                                                   \n1 D     Very Good;Very Good;Very Good;Good;Good;Premium;Premium;Ideal;Ideal;Ver…\n2 E     Ideal;Premium;Good;Fair;Premium;Premium;Very Good;Very Good;Very Good;G…\n3 F     Premium;Very Good;Very Good;Very Good;Good;Premium;Very Good;Very Good;…\n4 G     Very Good;Ideal;Ideal;Very Good;Premium;Premium;Ideal;Very Good;Ideal;P…\n5 H     Very Good;Very Good;Very Good;Good;Good;Very Good;Good;Very Good;Very G…\n6 I     Premium;Very Good;Ideal;Good;Premium;Ideal;Ideal;Ideal;Ideal;Very Good;…\n7 J     Good;Very Good;Good;Ideal;Ideal;Good;Good;Very Good;Very Good;Very Good…\n\n\nFinally, if we wanted to just get the unique values of the cuts in a single line, we can use unique:\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% select(color, cut) %&gt;% \n  group_by(color) %&gt;% \n  summarize(all_colors=\n              paste(unique(cut), collapse=\";\")) \n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  color all_colors                       \n  &lt;ord&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                            \n1 D     Very Good;Good;Premium;Ideal;Fair\n2 E     Ideal;Premium;Good;Fair;Very Good\n3 F     Premium;Very Good;Good;Fair;Ideal\n4 G     Very Good;Ideal;Premium;Good;Fair\n5 H     Very Good;Good;Premium;Fair;Ideal\n6 I     Premium;Very Good;Ideal;Good;Fair\n7 J     Good;Very Good;Ideal;Premium;Fair\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2018,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Group\\_by/Summarize: {Not} Just for Numeric Values!},\n  date = {2018-05-24},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2018. “Group_by/Summarize: Not Just for Numeric\nValues!” May 24, 2018."

In some ways, there is this negative perception that it is inauthentic, slimy, and self-serving.\nHere’s the thing. Networking is not about selling yourself. It’s about finding real and meaningful connections to people. And that comes from being curious about other people, not from selling yourself.\nAfter a long time of networking the wrong way, I think I’ve found a way of networking that works for me.

    "text": "1. Networking as Your Authentic Self\nBe Yourself. This can be really hard, especially if you’re uncomfortable in large social situations. You have to find ways to make yourself comfortable.\nI will be honest and say that I can be tremendously awkward. But I’ve learned to let my curiosity show, and that seems to be what works for me.\nDon’t come in with the intention to blow away or impress someone with your accomplishments. Another pitfall of networking is being too eager to impress someone. This can result in a lot of discomfort on both sides.\nThe best thing about informational interviewing is that it helps you find the deep connections with someone else. If you ask questions about these deep connections, you’ll start forging bonds. Remember, play the long game.\nWhen you meet someone, ask yourself: how could we work together? How could we help each other? This gets you into the right frame of mind. For one, you aren’t intimidated by the accomplishments of someone you meet. On the other hand, you aren’t being condescending to them. Remember, curiosity is a great way to forge connections.\nIf you can help someone with a five minute favor, that is a low key way to connect."

    "text": "2. Bring Your Curiosity\nLet curiosity be your guide. Ask authentic questions. I was taught early on that informational interviewing was the most important way to network. What is an informational interview? I define it as being curious about someone and asking good questions to get the conversation going.\nActive listening and asking questions are some of the fastest ways to connect with people. It’s true, but you need to find a style that works for you.\nYou have to find yourself in a mindset where you are curious about the other person. And that mindset is where you can start asking interesting questions that show that you’re really curious about them and their passions. Curiosity is the great democratizer and leveler.\nIf someone asks an interesting question during a session, that’s a good person to talk with afterwards. You have something to talk about. Just be careful of those people who seem to be intentionally antagonistic; you want someone who is also curious.\nDon’t be so quick to swipe left. Give people a chance to share their story. It is true that most people are not immediately relevant to you and your chosen field. But these people can be an incredible asset to you. Again, let curiosity be your guide. This is your opportunity to learn from them, and the gratitude that arises from learning something new can be a powerful motivator.\nYou never know. Most of the literature of successful networkers point out that it is usually our acquaintances to which we have weak ties that helps us find new work."

If there are volunteer opportunities or hackathons, these are low key ways of doing activities together. Especially when you’re working on things together in small groups, the opportunities to be curious about each other will come up.\nOne of the most fruitful activities I participated in was the rOpenSci unconference in 2018. I met a ton of people I am still really good friends with. I also participated in the 2019 Symposium on Statistics and Data Science. Through moderating a session on education, and a speed mentoring session, I met a ton of like-minded people. I also gained a reputation as a booster - I was as supportive as I could be of everyone in that session. CSVconf and RStudioConf were also great opportunities to meet people.\nThere are usually student volunteer opportunities at nearly every event, which let you not only meet people, but participate in events for free or for a reduced discount. Also, there are great groups such as R-Ladies and PyLadies which are great places to meet like-minded people."

Good informational interviewing takes time to learn; you need to practice at it, and especially with people you feel comfortable with. That way, if you slip up, it won’t feel as catastrophic. Being able to be gentle with yourself and laugh at your mistakes will really help you here.\nYou’ll begin to identify, through active listening, the deep connection points. It’s easier to learn this by practicing with someone you know.\nDon’t start with the cold informational interview, where you ask your neighbor about something. This is actually the highest level of difficulty, where you know nothing about someone."

One thing I used to do was identify one or two people and put all of my networking eggs in one basket, especially if they were well known. If I couldn’t meet that person, then I thought I was wasting my time. Again, everyone is interesting, so adjust your expectations.\nNetworking can be exhausting. Don’t push yourself too hard. Set some hard limits when networking. Don’t expect to be able to talk with everyone. Maybe talking to three people at a conference is all you can do right now. That’s fine. With practice, you’ll be able to do more.\nRemember, almost everyone at conferences is in the same boat as you. Be gentle on yourself, and you’ll figure it out."

    "text": "I’m teaching an R Programming course next term. Jessica Minnier and I are developing the Ready for R Materials into a longer and more involved course.\nI think one of the most important things is to teach people how to self-learn. As learning to program is a lifelong learning activity, it’s critically important to give them these meta-learning skills. So that’s the motivation behind the Tidyverse function of the Week assignment.\nI asked on Twitter:\n\n\nHi Everyone. I’m teaching an #rstats course next quarter. One assignment is to have each student write about a #tidyverse function. What it’s for and an example.What are some less known #tidyverse functions that do a job you find useful?\n\n— Ted Laderas, PhD 🏳️‍🌈 (@tladeras) November 30, 2020\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of the highlights from the thread.\nI loved all of these. Danielle Quinn wins the MVP award for naming so many useful functions:\n\n\ndplyr::uncount()tidyr::complete()tidyr::fill() / replace_na()stringr::str_detect() / str_which()lubridate::ymd_hms() and related functionsggplot2::labs() - so simple, yet under appreciated!\n\n— Danielle Quinn (she/her) (@daniellequinn88) December 1, 2020\n\n\nfill() was highly suggested:\n\n\ntidyr::fill() - extremely useful when creating a usable dataset out of a spreadsheet originally built for data entry, in which redundant informations are only reported once at the beginning of the group they refer to, rather than in every row as needed for the analysis.\n\n— Luca Foppoli (@foppoli_luca) December 1, 2020\n\n\nMany people suggested the window functions, including lead() and lag() and the cumulative functions:\n\n\nCheck out the dplyr window functions, cummin, cummax, cumany and cumall. They don’t seen useful at first but they can solve really tricky aggregation problems. https://t.co/aDpXqSB2Vx\n\n— Robert Kubinec (@rmkubinec) December 1, 2020\n\n\nAlison Hill suggested problems(), which helps you diagnose why your data isn’t loading:\n\n\nOoh problems is a good function for importing rx https://t.co/P4ZR57PgOG\n\n— Alison Presmanes Hill (@apreshill) December 1, 2020\n\n\nI think that deframe() and enframe() are really exciting, since I do this operation all the time:\n\n\ntibble::deframe(), tibble::deframe()coercing a two-column df to named vector, which I prefer immensely to names(df) &lt;- vec_of_names\n\n— E. David Aja (@PeeltothePithy) December 1, 2020\n\n\nunite(), separate() and separate_rows() also had their own contingent:\n\n\nI find myself using tidyr::unite() a lot to clean messy data - particularly useful for making unique and informative ID’s for each row. coalesce() and fill() are also little known gems! :)\n\n— Guy Sutton🐝🌾🇿🇦🇿🇼 (@Guy_F_Sutton) December 1, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nI was bowled over by all of the replies. This was an unexpectedly really fun thread, and lots of recommendations from others.\nI thought I would try and summarize everyone’s suggestions and compile a list of recommended functions. I used this script with some modifications to pull all the replies to my tweet. In particular, I had to request for extended tweet mode, and I extracted a few more fields from the returned JSON.\nThis wrote the tweet information into a CSV file.\nThen I started parsing the data. I wrote a couple of functions, remove_users_from_text(), which removes the users from a tweet (by looking for words that begin with @) and get_funcs(), which uses a relatively simple regular expression to try to return the function (it looks for paired parentheses () or an underscore “-” to extract the functions). It actually works pretty well, and grabs most of the functions.\nThen I use separate_rows() to split the multiple functions into their separate rows. This makes it easier to tally all the functions.\n\nremove_users_from_text &lt;- function(col){\n  str_replace_all(col, \"\\\\@\\\\w*\", \"\")\n  \n}\n\nget_funcs &lt;- function(col){\n  out &lt;- str_extract_all(col, \"\\\\w*\\\\(\\\\)|\\\\w*_\\\\w*\")\n  paste(out[[1]], collapse=\", \")  \n}\n\nparsed_tweets &lt;- tweets %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(text = remove_users_from_text(text)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(funcs = get_funcs(text)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  separate_rows(funcs, sep=\", \") %&gt;%\n  select(date, user, funcs, text, reply, parent_thread) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\nwrite_csv(parsed_tweets, file = \"cleaned_tweets_incomplete.csv\")\n\nrmarkdown::paged_table(parsed_tweets[1:10,-c(5:6)])\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAt this point, I realized that I just needed to hand annotate the rest of the tweets, rather than wasting my time trying to parse the rest of the cases.

Danielle Quinn wins the MVP award for naming so many useful functions:\n\n\ndplyr::uncount()tidyr::complete()tidyr::fill() / replace_na()stringr::str_detect() / str_which()lubridate::ymd_hms() and related functionsggplot2::labs() - so simple, yet under appreciated!\n\n— Danielle Quinn (she/her) (@daniellequinn88) December 1, 2020\n\n\nfill() was highly suggested:\n\n\ntidyr::fill() - extremely useful when creating a usable dataset out of a spreadsheet originally built for data entry, in which redundant informations are only reported once at the beginning of the group they refer to, rather than in every row as needed for the analysis.\n\n— Luca Foppoli (@foppoli_luca) December 1, 2020\n\n\nMany people suggested the window functions, including lead() and lag() and the cumulative functions:\n\n\nCheck out the dplyr window functions, cummin, cummax, cumany and cumall. They don’t seen useful at first but they can solve really tricky aggregation problems. https://t.co/aDpXqSB2Vx\n\n— Robert Kubinec (@rmkubinec) December 1, 2020\n\n\nAlison Hill suggested problems(), which helps you diagnose why your data isn’t loading:\n\n\nOoh problems is a good function for importing rx https://t.co/P4ZR57PgOG\n\n— Alison Presmanes Hill (@apreshill) December 1, 2020\n\n\nI think that deframe() and enframe() are really exciting, since I do this operation all the time:\n\n\ntibble::deframe(), tibble::deframe()coercing a two-column df to named vector, which I prefer immensely to names(df) &lt;- vec_of_names\n\n— E. David Aja (@PeeltothePithy) December 1, 2020\n\n\nunite(), separate() and separate_rows() also had their own contingent:\n\n\nI find myself using tidyr::unite() a lot to clean messy data - particularly useful for making unique and informative ID’s for each row. coalesce() and fill() are also little known gems! :)\n\n— Guy Sutton🐝🌾🇿🇦🇿🇼 (@Guy_F_Sutton) December 1, 2020"

    "text": "I was bowled over by all of the replies. This was an unexpectedly really fun thread, and lots of recommendations from others.\nI thought I would try and summarize everyone’s suggestions and compile a list of recommended functions. I used this script with some modifications to pull all the replies to my tweet. In particular, I had to request for extended tweet mode, and I extracted a few more fields from the returned JSON.\nThis wrote the tweet information into a CSV file.\nThen I started parsing the data. I wrote a couple of functions, remove_users_from_text(), which removes the users from a tweet (by looking for words that begin with @) and get_funcs(), which uses a relatively simple regular expression to try to return the function (it looks for paired parentheses () or an underscore “-” to extract the functions). It actually works pretty well, and grabs most of the functions.\nThen I use separate_rows() to split the multiple functions into their separate rows. This makes it easier to tally all the functions.\n\nremove_users_from_text &lt;- function(col){\n  str_replace_all(col, \"\\\\@\\\\w*\", \"\")\n  \n}\n\nget_funcs &lt;- function(col){\n  out &lt;- str_extract_all(col, \"\\\\w*\\\\(\\\\)|\\\\w*_\\\\w*\")\n  paste(out[[1]], collapse=\", \")  \n}\n\nparsed_tweets &lt;- tweets %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(text = remove_users_from_text(text)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(funcs = get_funcs(text)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  separate_rows(funcs, sep=\", \") %&gt;%\n  select(date, user, funcs, text, reply, parent_thread) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\nwrite_csv(parsed_tweets, file = \"cleaned_tweets_incomplete.csv\")\n\nrmarkdown::paged_table(parsed_tweets[1:10,-c(5:6)])\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAt this point, I realized that I just needed to hand annotate the rest of the tweets, rather than wasting my time trying to parse the rest of the cases.

There is a cure for that, and that is finding co-organizers for your meetup.\nThese co-organizers should be people you can trust and depend on, that you want to hang out with. Even if no one else came to a meetup event, you will still get to hang out with them and it won’t feel like wasted effort. You should have shared values.\nIt’s better to identify people and approach them directly rather than putting out a call for organizers. Perhaps there was a member of previous meetups that was especially helpful to others.\nThe key piece of advice that I’ve gotten from many organizers is to: start small with your core group, rather than starting with large events from the get-go. Having a strong core group will naturally grow through word of mouth."

Or you can divide duties - such as communications and moderation between you.\nSupport each other - some months may not good for organizing for you, and hopefully the other members of your team will be able to step up.\nPart of the point of spreading the duties is to be able to take breaks so that organizing is not a burden on you. Especially in online situations, having more than one organizer can be very helpful."

    "text": "Find Sponsors\nFinding sponsors and allies is especially important if you’re organizing a meetup within your own organization. There are specific needs for your meetup:\n\nMeetup Space\nDedicated online discussion forums (such as Slack/Microsoft Teams/Discord)\nPrep time for talks/activities\n\nSponsors can help with these needs. I’ve heard time and again from internal meetup attendees that they like the meetup, but they’re often too busy with other work to attend regularly. This is often a sign of an organizational culture that prizes busy-ness (not business) over personal development. Sponsors can help with this by opening up work schedules for personal development."

    "text": "Get Recognized For Organizing\nMost importantly, if you organize an internal group, you should be getting recognition for your own work organizing the meetup. Organizing meetups is important emotional labor, as you are building ties across groups in your organization. Negotiating for protected time when you can do this work is a very good start. Making sure that the meetup is included as criteria for yearly reviews is also important. If you are doing it to benefit your organization, you should be recognized for it.\nMeetups often result in collaboration across groups, and improved morale in an organization. Organizations often brag that they are a learning organization. Hold their feet to the fire so that they support this important venue for learning, collaboration, and development. Some of this may have to do with managing up: understanding the motivations of your supervisors and showing the benefits of the meetup in language that matters to them. At the very least, show alignment of your group with their overall strategy - show how the meetup will contribute to their goals.\nGathering testimonies from meetup attendees is another important type of evidence of impact. Approaching people who are getting a lot out of your meetup and asking for a couple sentences about the benefits they’ve enjoyed from the meetup can be very useful, especially in a final report used in a performance review."

Sustaining a meetup has to do a lot with making it appealing to people who will contribute, and making it easy for those people to contribute. We’ll talk about some low-key activities that will help with this."

This dataset is interesting because it’s derived from a multivariate distribution based on real patient data, modeled as a Bayesian Network. Even when we knew true marginals for the real data, there was a lot of fine tuning to the Bayesian Network.\nWe’ve used this dataset for a couple of classes, and we’ve found that it helps highlight real issues in predictive modeling of clinical data. One of the largest is that most predictive models are based on a much older patient cohort (50+), which means that we don’t know much about how to predict cardiovascular risk in younger patients. Part of the teaching exercise is having the students choose a cohort of interest and then attempt to predict on that patient cohort.\nThe data is currently available as an R package here, including vignettes about how the data was generated: https://github.com/laderast/cvdRiskData\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2017,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Using {Synthetic} {Data} for {Teaching} {Data} {Science}},\n  date = {2017-12-14},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2017. “Using Synthetic Data for Teaching Data\nScience.” December 14, 2017."

We value meaningful and deep connections rather than shallow ones.\nThe world of conferences doesn’t really value introverts, but it needs us (at least there are some people thinking about making conferences more introvert friendly).

    "text": "Improving User Experience Through Establishing Best Practices\nOne of my major passions in my work is to improve the overall user experience of the DNAnexus platform by establishing and suggesting effective workflows and best practices for getting tasks accomplished on the platform. These tasks include:\n\nExecuting batch jobs on the platform\nWorking with RStudio Effectively on RAP\nWorking with Docker\nDecoding pheno data from raw values\nUsing bash effectively on RAP.\n\nEach of these accomplishments has stemmed from observing gaps in customer knowledge in the platform. I believe that one of the biggest barriers to using the platform is still the feeling of impostor syndrome and I am passionate about giving customers the knowledge they need in formats that are helpful for them.\n\n104 - Cloud Computing for HPC Users. This was a course and webinar that I developed with Anastazie Sedlakova and Scott Funkhouser. It attempts to directly map skills and concepts that incoming users already have with on-premise HPC and directly translates these skills to cloud HPC. It has been rated highly by both UKB RAP users and other customers.\n312 - JSON for the DNAnexus Platform - This is a course that I developed that fills in a lot of the gaps with utilizing JSON effectively on the DNAnexus platform. It helps users who are unfamiliar with JSON read and modify JSON for use in applets, but also in parsing JSON responses with the platform using jq, and doing batch submissions with jq.\nBash for Bioinformatics - In response to many of the challenges that I have seen with customers and app development and running jobs, I put together a “missing manual” that addresses the gaps in knowledge of bash scripting and where this knowledge is helpful on the platform. It has gotten positive reception not only on the UKB RAP community, but also by Solution Science as a resource they can point potential customers to.\nRStudio for RAP webinar - With Anastazie Sedlakova, I developed a webinar that outlined how to work reproducibly with RStudio on UKB RAP. This involved not only showing users how to use RStudio Projects, but also how to save software environments for reproducible research, and run RStudio/Bioconductor via Docker containers.\nDocker for RAP webinar - This was a webinar that I developed with Ondrej Klempir on how to effectively use Docker on UKB RAP for batch processing. It provides specific bash recipes for saving docker image files, extending docker images, and running batch jobs with Docker image files.\nxvhelper - this is an R Package I have developed to help R users with decoding Pheno data extracted from the new dx extract_dataset functionality in dx-toolkit. R users are a major percentage of UKB RAP users, and this package will helps them with their overall user experience with the pheno data."

I’ll talk about a few.\n\nCarl Howe’s Talk: The Next Million R Users\n\n\nMel Gregory: RStudio for Education\nCarl Howe (Director of Education for RStudio) presented a number of resources that RStudio is providing for educational purposes. Their goal is to train the next million R users. Here are some of the RStudio based educational resources that might be useful for everyone.\n\nRStudio Cloud is now available free for people who teach courses, who can send them a course syllabus to gain access. RStudio Cloud includes resources to make coursework publically or privately available, allows instructors to install default packages, and gives students an immediate way to start playing with R/RStudio. We are definitely going to use this in teaching our BMI 569/669 Data Analytics course. Mel Gregory’s talk was about the nuts and bolts of using RStudio Cloud in a classroom situation. Highly recommended to get familiar with the basics.\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel also has a Data Science In a Box course available that can be forked and used by anyone. There is a great discussion of how to use the course and the tech stack (RStudio Cloud, GitHub, and Slack) needed to make the course runnable.\nThere are also a number of LearnR Tutorials built into RStudio Cloud called RStudio Primers that cover a lot of basic RStudio operations for the self-directed learners.\n\nJessica Minnier and I presented at the poster session about our LearnR tutorials, DSIExplore and dataLiteracyTutorial and our burro package, which lets users explore a new dataset with a simplified Shiny App. There’s even a function that lets you build a shiny app from a dataset that you can publish to a Shiny server such as shinyapps.io or RStudio Connect for sharing and having a data scavenger hunt together. Or as Angela Bassa calls it, an EDA Party. Whoo!\n\n\nIrene Stevens’ Talk: Teaching Data Science With Puzzles\nI really loved Irene Stevens’ talk about Teaching Data Science Using Puzzles. Irene and Jenny Bryan put together a simple project-based framework that lets students download simple data wrangling puzzles per week, lets them submit their answer to an answer server and get feedback, and when they solve it, it creates a minimal reproducible example (reprex) to share with their puzzle community. Very Slick!\n\n\nKelly Bodwin: Introductory Statistics with R\nKelly Bodwin gave a presentation of how she used Shiny apps as an intermediate step as part of an approach to teaching introductory statistics. Kelly is of the opinion that coding is good even for non majors, and her Shiny apps provide an intermediate step between a more click-based app and coding, asking the students to input their variables, their hypothesis, and highlights the output that results. I really liked this approach. I also really loved this slide:"

She especially emphasized that data science was her path out of lower incomes and that she thought it needs to be more accessible to all. She talked about the barriers to going from “Using your computer for Netflix” to “Using your computer for data science” as real, and what she learned as a community manager for the R4DS learning community. Finally, she ended with a call for data scientists to share their mistakes, in order to model that making mistakes is ok.\n\n\nCaitlin Hudon: Learning from Eight Years of Data Science Mistakes\nSpeaking of mistakes, Caitlin Hudon gave a talk called “Learning from Eight Years of Data Science Mistakes”, which was really helpful. One of her messages was that “Mistakes count as experience”, and learning from past mistakes is extremely helpful for the whole team. However, it must be safe for team members to share their mistakes, and so creating the right culture of respect and teaching is important. This includes documentation, and including pseudocode next to the actual code to talk non-data scientists through is important. Likewise, making sure that you are solving the correct business problem requires communication. I really liked her discussion of the Rhetorical Triangle as a way to frame communications: Speaker, Audience, and Context.\n\n\nTracy Teal: Teaching R using inclusive pedagogy: Practices and lessons learned from over 700 Carpentries workshops\nTracy Teal from Data Carpentries also talked about their efforts to Teaching R using inclusive pedagogy, including fostering a growth mindset. Their instructor training is a wonderful 2-day crash course in teaching, and I’m going to propose that it be offered to our graduate students to prep them for teaching. (Full disclosure: I’ve contributed to these course materials.) I also appreciated how candid she was about how much further they need to go to increase the diversity of participants.\nDiversity and Inclusiveness was also a theme of Angela Bassa’s talk about Team Data Science. She pointed out that data science teams need to be diverse to serve audiences who are highly diverse."

Tonya Filz also gave a talk about being a Resilient R Champion at your organization, stressing these issues and giving us case studies/examples to show leaders at your organization.\n\n\nHilary Parker: Cultivating creativity in Data work\nHilary Parker’s talk about Creativity and Data Science in the Organization, about applying system design principles to data science. Rather than thinking of ourselves as having a traditional role at the end of the analysis, Hilary suggested that we partipate in all parts of the process, including data collection. Her group suggested a change in an app, which resulted in a brand new data stream for them to analyse.\n\n\nAngela Bassa: Data science as a team sport\nAngela Bassa’s Talk about Team Data Science talked about the organizational aspects of making a data team, including specializing roles, making sure that knowledge and expertise was distributed, and managing burnout by making sure that no one team member is overloaded. She stressed resilience within a team by making sure that people are taking care of themselves, having redundancy in the team. Process is also important, by making sure data is well documented, by allotting time. She also stressed the importance of young and new data scientists to the team, because they aren’t biased with previous knowledge. I also thought she had excellent arguments about the cost of not expanding your data team - potential users who would be lost."

Karthik Ram, Tracy Teal, Angela Bassa, and Hilary Parker all fielded questions about growing as a data scientist. One of my favorite remarks was from Tracy Teal, who mused about the possibility of a Leadership Carpentry, teaching potential leaders essential skills such as mentoring, faciliation skills, and valuing team contributions. Angela Bassa also had a great quote that “leadership is programming people”. She also pointed out that the role of Data Scientists is to “Question Dogma” and pointed out the importance of saying “I don’t know”.\n\n\nDavid Robinson: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Public Work\n\n\n\nMaking your work public\n\n\nThe growth mindset was also a theme of Dave Robinson’s Keynote, which was about making your data science work public at a number of levels. He outlined a number of different types of public contributions, such as short form (tweets, discussions about data), long form (blogs), code contributions, and even writing a book."

I won’t crib her story, because her telling it was a delightful journey and I encourage you to watch it for yourself at the link above. Part of her point was that programming pedagogy is dominated by the “tyranny of fun”, rather than focusing on teaching fundamentals. One of the problems with programming education is that we haven’t defined what these fundamentals are, compared to the pedagogy of reading, which talks about teaching with fundamentals such as phonics.\nWe expect students to explore things without teaching them enough, and that actually hurts their progress. Instead, we should also be teaching fundamentals, such as code reading out loud and rote memorization of programming patterns. By utilizing these fundamentals, she has found improved learning outcomes. As she says, motivation comes from seeing progress, not necessarily from exploration alone. Her results on using direct instruction have showed improved outcomes in terms of motivation.\nI have to admit that this talk really opened my eyes to the blind spots we have in programming education. Looking forward to incorporating these ideas in my coursework."

All the slides and workshop materials are available at the above links.\nSparklyR Workshop\nI liked this workshop from John Mount of Win-Vector. It started out with a dplyr intro, and introduced us to the basics of Apache Spark, which is a cluster-computing based machine learning framework, which is designed to do very large queries and machine learning. RStudio’s Edgar Ruiz managed to get us each an RStudio Pro Instance running on AWS with all the required packages installed so we could test out the SparklyR package, which uses dplyr’s commands to run Spark jobs.\nIn-Memory Computing Essentials for Data Scientists\nThis was an introduction to Apache Ignite, which is a distributed, in-memory database that can be leveraged by different languages. The really interesting thing about Ignite is that it will colocate related data on the same cluster node, resulting in rapid queries within each node. I think this technology will become very important as we need more datasets to be openly accessible to compute on."

I thought the explanation of his process (isolate specific ideas, identify data structures, leverage visualization algorithms). Check out the slides above. They’re very cool.\nThe Wonder Twins: Data Science and Human Centered Design\nThis was a really interesting talk about the interplay between data science and design in helping encourage a mobile money system in Tanzania. It was inspiring to see how they had both designers and data scientists embedded and looking at how the mobile payment system worked. One interesting example was doing network analysis of the Mobile Money Agents, who distribute cash. They targeted a highly influential group of these agents based on this analysis. Very cool.\nThe People’s Data and The Deontology of Data Science\nI thought these were really interesting sides about the human side of data science. DJ Patil, who was chief data scientist under the Obama administration, talked about citizen-driven data projects and how it enabled a number of advances. The most interesting case was basically a parent built an online community of people who had a very rare disease condition so he could help his son with the condition.\nIgor Perisic (of LinkedIn) followed this with a talk about ethical issues in data science. In particular, he identified three different areas to concentrate on: 1) The Ethics of Data, 2) The Ethics of Algorithms, and 3) The Ethics of practice. He concentrated on the recent New York Times article about using machine learning to identify potential re-offenders in the prison system. The lack of transparency in how the algorithm identifies potential reoffenders is a huge ethical problem.\nIn all, I had an interesting time and I met lots of people in industry, which was a nice contrast to the academic side of things."

With our collaborators, I showed them my work and they seemed excited. Unfortunately, this “excitement” turned into unreasonable demands. I was literally trying to do a full time development position while balancing the demands of other projects, including teaching. I started feeling like a machine, where each of my collaborators just wanted me to output figures and analyses.\nThe worst I’ve ever felt is when I have been busting my ass for things I don’t believe in, or have been stretched across too many projects.

I took a number of courses in the program, including courses in Systems Theory and different modeling methods. The largest room, where classes were mostly held, was probably no larger that 15 feet by 15 feet, and we were crammed in there in a very tight square of tables.\nSure it was run down, but we always thought it fit the Systems Science program, and it made us feel like the underdogs. I spent countless hours in that room, having wonderful conversations with students of so many backhrounds.\nMy time there was intertwined with reading many of the classics of systems science: Herbert Simon, information theory, network theory, System Dynamics and differential equations, queue theory, among others. Conversations with other students in the courses was always super productive. And fascinating, because you were equally likely to talk with marketing folks, economists, and biologists. All different walks of life.\nI’ve often said that the strength of systems science is it’s treatment of relationships and interactions, of understanding these relationships holistically 1. In fact, I gave a talk for their weekly seminar called “How Are Data Science and System Science connected?” where I talked about how systems science can improve feature engineering in machine learning.\nIt might seem very abstract from the outside, but systems science is concerned with real world phenomena. I learned how to read and understand the flow of systems of differential equations by building models and perturbing them. I learned the importance of feedback and how it can push a system into different states. I learned about information theory and reconstructability analysis and how you can use it to untangle systems based on outputs and inputs. I learned about networks and hierarchies and tested some of the ideas on biological systems.\nThe Systems Science Program lives on, and Harder House was just a place, but I thought I’d talk a little bit about the history of it and acknowledge my own debt to the program; it has made me a much more well rounded thinker and always looking for the metaphoric connections between different fields."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Collaboration as Improvisation\nCollaboration is a delicate thing. It needs to be nurtured and encouraged, especially in the early stages. It is easy to destroy it if you go in with the wrong expectations and attitude.\nA lot of what I have learned about collaboration can be summed in the “Yes, and…” rule of comic improvisation:\n\nThe basic concept of these two words is that you are up for anything, and will go along with whatever gets thrown your way. Essentially, you don’t use the word “No” in improv very often! The “And” part comes in when you are in a scene and can add to what your partner started rather than detract from it. - Second City\n\nIn collaboration, you need to build on what your partner is doing. Doing so requires openness and lack of ego. You are extending and supporting each other. You are creating something new in your journey together, and it will not be like what you do on your own. That is a wonderful thing.\nThis is obviously the opposite of what we’re taught in academia. In academia, we’re taught that we need to analyze things and take them apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the “Yes, and…” rule, we are synthesizing instead of analyzing. We are putting things together, taking risks, and hopefully having fun and being energized on the way.\n\n\n“Yes, and…” IRL Example\nWhat does the “Yes, and…” rule look like in real life?\nAs an example, I worked with other members of the OHSU’s Educator’s Collaborative. We were having a discussion during our virtual coffee break about how we can best support online students during COVID.\nEventually, we realized that we wanted to work on something together. We wanted to show fellow educators concrete advice on how to support students.\nThrough talking some more, we identified ways of doing this: encouraging psychological safety through a code of conduct, providing a forum and space for student support in courses, and identifying open educational resources to utilize in courses rather than making students purchase expensive textbooks.\nThe result was an hour-long presentation that came together on these themes. It was a really positive experience that leveraged each of our strengths and demonstrated concrete and evidence-based steps to support students.\n\n\nRespect and Sharing Values is Key to Taking Risks Together\nAt the heart of this collaboration was our respect for each other’s knowledge and values. We knew we could share our experiences and our desire to help students.\nImagine if one of us proposed something, and another of us just shot it down. Where can we go from there? Not many places.\nBut if we build and encourage each other, we can find new paths by taking risks together. Tina Fey had a great perspective on this:\n\nAdd to the discussion. In the example above, the second person did not just say, “Yes we’re at the beach,” she said, “I can’t wait to get in the water, I hope it’s not too cold.” This statement adds value to the scene. Now the audience knows it’s cold and that we plan to enjoy the ocean as opposed to looking for gold or taking a yoga class.\n\n\nTo me, this rule challenges you to contribute. Whether you are developing an ad campaign or deciding where to eat dinner, put your neck out there, give your thoughts and have a say. Two minds are always better than one. - Tina Fey, Bossypants\n\nIn collaboration, you need to focus on adding value, not subtracting from other’s contributions. Don’t judge your collaborator’s contributions. Nothing is more demotivating nor more destructive of a fledgling collaboration.\nEncourage each other, make your own psychologically safe space together. This space can be difficult to establish, but if you respect each other, it will be ok to take risks together.\n\n\nTJ and Dave: Tapping Into the Flow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an extreme example of the “Yes, and…” rule, look at TJ and Dave, two masters of long-form improvisation. Their shows are completely improvised from scratch each time. Somehow, for every performance, they manage to fill an hour and make people collapse with laughter. It is creation on the edge of chaos, and they always manage to make something.\nTJ and Dave talk about their improv as tapping into a flow of events that’s external to them, and that the improv is just tapping into that flow. Ego or who authored what doesn’t come into play - they are just vessels for this flow. They seem incredibly humbled and grateful to be able to tap into this, and this keeps their collaboration fresh.\nWhen you find a good collaborative partner, you can channel the flow together. It is a form of play, and it is energizing and fun.\n\n\nAsking Great Questions for the Setup: The 2000 year old man\nThe 2000 Year Old Man was a comedy routine that Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks came up with together while working together in a writer’s room. Carl played an interviewer asking a 2000 year old man (played by Brooks) questions about daily life as 2000 year old man, did he meet certain historical figures, etc. It was completely improvised and Mel’s responses were usually pretty darn funny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMel’s responses always got the laughs, but Carl’s role was especially important. He asked the right questions that Mel could build his answers on. His questions set up Mel for success:\n\nCarl Reiner was a master of the underrated art of the setup. Most “straight men” are known for their responses that release the laugh. Carl did that too, but even more brilliantly, he subtly puts all of the pieces into play for Mel Brooks to push off of into the comedy stratosphere. - Anne Librera\n\nWhat lessons can we apply from Carl Reiner? When collaborating, ask yourself: how can I ask these kinds of questions and set up my collaborators to push off into that stratosphere? How can I set ourselves up to capture lightning in a bottle?\n\n\nHow to Find IRL Collaborators: Share Values\nThe best way to find collaborators is to find people who share your values.\nThere are a lot of opportunties for this: help organize a conference, join a community of practice, find an open-source project that encourages first-time contributors. Work on putting together a workshop with someone - this is a great way to make connections quickly. Be curious about other people’s work; that curiosity can be the start of a great relationship. Again, early on, focus on the relationship, not the output product.\nThe majority of my educational collaborations have come about because I share values with my collaborators. Wanting to make education more inclusive and accessible has been a great value to unify on.\nIf you meet someone who shares your values and could be fun, try and find a way to work together.\n\n\nIt’s All About Fun, Energy, and Connection\nCollaboration is an antidote to the loneliness we all feel nowadays. Science can be a very lonely place, and it sometimes seems that when you present ideas to others, there’s always someone who wants to shoot it down. (I’ve often felt like a grant could best be defined as a dream a reviewer stomps to death.) This is very draining.\nIn contrast, a good collaboration can be energizing and fun. We may downplay fun, but it is an important part of any collaboration.\nWe need to know when we need to re-evaluate our collaborations. The canary in the coal mine for any collaboration is the question: am I having fun in this collaboration?\nIf this collaboration is something you volunteered to do (that is, you’re not being paid), and it’s no longer fun, you have my permission to drop the collaboration. Life is too short to spend on voluntary activities that are not fun.\n\n\nTL; DR\nHere’s a quick list of ground rules that synthesizes the above.\n\nWork with those who respect you and share your values.\nValue the collaborative relationship (which is long-term) over any short-term products.\nUse the “Yes, and…” rule. Add to your collaborator’s contributions, don’t detract from them.\nTake risks and make something cool together.\nSet each other up for success.\nHave fun together. Stop if it’s no longer fun.\n\n\n\nThank You, Open Science Communities\nFinally, I want to end on a personal note and express gratitude for everyone who has helped me on my journey.\nAt an especially low time in my life, the communities of Open Science saved me, showing me a positive way to do science. This started with Mozilla Open Leaders, BioData Club and Code for Science and Society. There are countless others, including rOpenSci, csvconf, RStudio Certified Educators, RStudioConf, R/Medicine, PDX-R, Cascadia-R Conf, R-Ladies, SDSS, and The Carpentries. Grateful for everyone I’ve met through participating that showed me a way forward.\nThis post is my love letter to them. Thank you, everyone.\n\n\nFor More Info\n\nBossypants by Tina Fey has a great summary of why “Yes, And…” can change your life.\nRead the oral history of the Upright Citizen’s Brigade to learn more about “Yes, and…” and Del Close, whose philosophy of performance is the foundation of theatre sports.\nMel Brooks’ Autobiography All about me! is full of his kudos for his collaborators, and awe at his education in comedy. Highly recommended.\nThe Carpentries material has much more information about teaching together (search for “Never Teach Alone” on this page).\nGreg Wilson’s book Teaching Tech Together has even more information about this.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2022,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {“{Yes,} and...” Is the Foundation of Collaboration},\n  date = {2022-02-27},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2022. “‘Yes, and...’ Is the Foundation\nof Collaboration.” February 27, 2022."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last week I had the good fortune to attend the From Evidence to Scholarship Conference at my alma mater, Reed College. The focus of the conference was improving the research process for undergraduates using digital scholarship. I came away from it excited about the work other people are doing in this realm and thinking about ways we could adapt these approaches.\nNicole Vasilevsky and I (both former Reedies) each gave talks, about our experience developing materials for Data Science and giving data science workshops to undergraduates.\nI found the conference to be very exciting and friendly overall. Laurie Allen kicked off the conference with a plenary session talking about the role digital scholarship librarians can have in the community surrounding them, talking about her work with Monument Lab and Data Refuge. Key takeaway point: it’s ok to do something badly if it gets the conversation started with the community.\nOne of the key takeaway points from the conference is the role that digital scholarship librarians have in revamping current curricula at the liberal arts colleges. They often do short-form training (in digital scholarship tools, such as webpage building and network analysis), which when integrated into a current course, can revitalize the course. Laura O’Brien and Hélène Bilis talked about integrating digital scholarship tools into a french literature course, talking about modeling the social networks of characters and how they evolved over time.\nAn exciting talk was about the ILiADS program, which is a multi-disciplinary digital scholarship program. It’s run as a summer institute which starts as teams of students, faculty and staff. The projects are student driven and they try to incorporate both students with the technical skills and those who are non-technical. I really liked this idea of teaming up students from different fields and having faculty to advise them as needed. I’d like to try something similar at OHSU.\nCollaboration with allied departments led to enhanced interdisciplinary courses. Jon Caris’ talk about his Spatial Analysis Lab at Smith College and the unexpected collaborations they had was a really great one, talking about using spatial analysis to analyze painting styles in the Painting III course, and using GIS to map out invasive species at a pond at Smith College for an intro Biology class. One of the best quotes from his talk was talking about emerging technology: “Emerging technology means that you’re in a perpetual state of incompetence. And that’s a fun place to be.”\nI’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Parveneh Abbaspour and Jeremy McWilliams’ talk about LCPhysX, which is an online video archive showcasing student projects in the physics department. The videos are really great, especially the one about the Golf Robot. The engagement of the students actually seems to have had an effect on admissions; a few of the new physics students actually noted that the LCPhysX site made them decide to go to Lewis and Clark.\nFinally, I really enjoyed Andrew Bray’s talk about his collaborative course, “Case Studies in Data Science: Elections”, where he solicited political scientists about important problems in voting for the students to tackle. By giving them some basic analyses in R, the students managed to complete a number of projects, including a package for visualizing ranked choice voting, which is actually being utilized for visualizing these results.\nI emerged from this conference excited about the passion that undergraduates have and excited about how digital scholarship librarians can change curricula for the better.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2018,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Some {Notes} from the {Evidence} to {Scholarship}\n    {Conference}},\n  date = {2018-03-19},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2018. “Some Notes from the Evidence to Scholarship\nConference.” March 19, 2018."

I had all sorts of grandiose plans for it, and I think my problem was that I was thinking too broad, too pie-in-the-sky. I’m going to try to focus on short and informative blog posts.\nOne of the things that I have been thinking about graduate school is the idea of building a Peer Mentoring culture in our department. I believe that students should help and support each other, and we need to provide a forum to do that. Not just assign mentors, but provide a time and a place to do that.\nWe try to foster a mentoring culture within our student group, BioData-Club. Students are free to talk about issues that concern them, especially about datasets, and are encouraged to share their experiences of software that they’ve used. I believe that we try to give students a psychologically safe place to talk about their issues with data. We try to make people feel like they’re not alone, and coach beginners so they can get over the hump.\nWe’re now embarking on an experiment to reach even more people at OHSU, because we know there are lots of students who struggle with practical skills in data analysis. Our group is growing, and that’s exciting.\nI’m going to try and get everyone in our group to write a paper about Peer Mentoring Culture and how to encourage it in other schools.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2017,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Fostering a {Peer} {Mentoring} {Culture}},\n  date = {2017-04-17},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2017. “Fostering a Peer Mentoring Culture.”\nApril 17, 2017."

    "text": "My dissertation paper, A Network-Based Model of Oncogenic Collaboration for Prediction of Drug Sensitivity is now published! Here’s a lay summary:\n\nOne outstanding issue in analyzing genomics in the context of personalized medicine is the incorporation of rare or infrequent genetic alterations (copy number alterations and somatic mutations) that are observed in individual patients. We hypothesize that these mutations may actually ‘collaborate’ with known oncogenes in the genesis of tumors through their interactions. In order to show this effect, we assess whether these interacting rare mutations cluster around known oncogenes and assess these mutational clusters, which we term surrogate oncogenes. We assess their statistical significance using a simple model of mutation. We show that surrogate oncogenes are predictive of drug sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, they are prevalent in three different cancer cohorts (Breast, Glioblastoma, and Bladder Cancer) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Within the Breast Cancer and Bladder Cancer populations, surrogate oncogenes are predictive of overall patient survival. The chief strength of the surrogate oncogene approach is that it can be run at a single-patient level in comparison to other methods of assessing mutational significance.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more, you can check out the Surrogate Oncogene Explorer in order to understand the nature of surrogate oncogenes, and my R/Bioconductor Package on GitHub if you’d like to try out the analysis.\nThere’s a follow-up paper that I’m working on that I’m very excited about. More news soon.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2015,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Surrogate {Oncogene} {Paper} Is {Published}},\n  date = {2015-12-23},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2015. “Surrogate Oncogene Paper Is\nPublished.” December 23, 2015."

    "text": "I was talking with a student and they were complaining that when at conferences, they would try to inject other topics of interest (such as cooking) into discussions with colleagues. Unfortunately, one of the after effects of this was that they were looked at as “not a serious scientist”. There’s an expectation that a scientist must be all depth, only talking and thinking about their sub-field.\nAs a cross disciplinarian, I have to say that is hogwash. The genesis of so many creative ideas in science has happened because of cross-pollination across disciplines. For example, microwave technology might never have been invented without the intersection of disciplines. We know that the Arts Foster Scientific Success - a large number of Nobel and National Academy members do art in some form or other. Bernstein et al theorize that\n\n“there exist functional connections between scientific talent and arts, crafts, and communications talents so that inheriting or developing one fosters the other.”\n\nHaving breadth and depth enables you to make connections that no one else has. It is the hallmark of a curious and creative person. These kinds of people are desparately needed to push science in new directions.\nI have a parallel career in performance and improvisational music. Music, for me, is endlessly inspiring and has forced me out of my introverted shell. One of the reasons I took up cello is that I can play many roles; accompanist, rhythm, solo. This flexibility in playing music has translated to my flexibility in collaboration. Being able to adjust to new circumstances and improvise new ideas to explore is a critical component of being a responsible scientist. My background improvisation has helped me pivot ideas. I have become less attached to dogmatic ideas. Many of my good ideas come from idle wondering about data that has captured my imagination. This is part of the reason why I teach students how to explore their data.\nSo, the next time another scientist looks down at you for being a polymath, pity them. Their world and their ideas are not as rich as yours.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Correlation Between Arts and Crafts and a Nobel Prize\nArts Foster Scientific Success\nDual Thinking for Scientists\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2017,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {On {Breadth} and {Depth} in {Your} {Academic} {Career}},\n  date = {2017-04-19},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2017. “On Breadth and Depth in Your Academic\nCareer.” April 19, 2017."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: I have come to believe that this post is way too harsh and unwelcoming to people interested in data science. I will post an update to this, and a FAQ for those who want informational interviews. But in the spirit of showing my mistakes, I’ll leave this up here.\n\n\nI have had many people who have asked me for informational interviews. They tell me that they are interested in Data Science and want to hear about what I do on a day to day basis. To be honest, I’ve begun to dread these kinds of interviews.\nInevitably, I spend a lot of energy explaining what I do to someone who rarely follows up. Consequently, I don’t find these interviews rewarding at all. So I’ve written this post so that I have a better time doing these kinds of interviews.\nI reserve the right to refuse interviews from people who do not read this.\n\nDo your homework. Please don’t expect me to give the five minute spiel about my research, hoping to look for an “in”. Please do some research and try to ask interesting questions about my work. I’ve given you plenty of resources on this website to know more about me. Ask me about my software, ask me about teaching, ask me carefully thought questions about my research.\nDon’t offer to buy me coffee. If I talk with you for 30 minutes, know that my time is worth far more than a cup of coffee. Instead, offer to pay it forwards. Volunteer with a group that does scientific communication or education; I don’t work with people who aren’t willing to teach others. I don’t work or talk with selfish people, having been burned many times by such people.\nBe specific in your ask. Asking about what next steps to take in learning data science and where to get a job is not specific enough. Again, do your research. What kinds of Data Science are you interested in? Are you interested in predictive analytics in healthcare? Or are you interested in systems modeling of disease? Be specific, and if you ask for something, make sure I can achieve it in five minutes or less.\nDon’t ask for a job, ask for connections. I know a decent number of people around Oregon and OHSU, so if you want me to introduce you to one of my connections, I’m happy to. If I know someone, I’m happy to do this, since it’s usually a five-minute ask.\nFollow up, and be willing to return the favor. Even a nice thank-you email is good. I’m happy to make you a Linkedin connection, if it means I can help someone else further down the line. If I expend energy on you, I’d like to see my impact. If my efforts meant that you managed to find a job, please let me know!\nRead Give and Take. This book by Adam Grant really struck me as the way to actually network. In short, I learned that if I want a return on my energy expenditure, I have to spend my energy on Givers, or people who help others. I am a Giver, but I now tend only to give informational interviewers to other Givers. The rest are too draining for me.\n\nI have given so many of these interviews and have gotten nothing from them. Not even a follow-up, which really is bad practice. So, if I’m considered difficult to approach about these, know it is because your previous askers have really been an energy drain and have been inconsiderate Takers. Make it interesting for me and be considerate. I’m much more likely to help you.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2018,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {If You Want to Talk with Me for an Informational Interview},\n  date = {2018-01-15},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2018. “If You Want to Talk with Me for an\nInformational Interview.” January 15, 2018."

    "text": "Want to learn how to build a website using {distill}? This is a short blog post explaining the basics of Distill.\nhttps://github.com/laderast/distill_website/\n\nWorkshop Video\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nLearn the basic components of a distill website\nBuild and preview your website using the Build tab\nCustomize the website with your bio and your picture\nAdd links and entries to your Navbar Menu\nAdd knitted html files as article links\nGet your website live using Netlify Drop\nUpdate your website by claiming it and registering it\nChange your domain name to a better one.\n\n\n\nBefore You Start\n\nInstall R/RStudio Desktop to your Computer.\nInstall the following packages in R:\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"postcards\", \"distill\", \"usethis\"))\n\nCreate a website project in your home directory using usethis.\n\nusethis::use_course(url=\"laderast/distill_website\",destdir=\".\")\n\nTake a look at the website before we get started:\n\nhttps://distill-example.netlify.app/\n\nGather up the follwing materials:\n\n\nLinks to Social Media (twitter, linkedin, etc)\nBio\nHeadshot\nKnitted .html files you want to share\n\n\nSign up for a netlify account and log in: https://netlify.com\n\n\n\nTaking a tour of the Project\nThese are the main files for the project.\n\nindex.Rmd - This is the main website page.\nabout.Rmd - This is a nice looking about page built using the {postcards} package.\nimage - A folder. Any images you put in here can be accessed by image/ted.jpg in your pages.\narticles/ - A folder. This is a nice place to park your articles. For right now, it’s probably easier to have self-contained articles (single html files)\n_site.yml - Customize this to change menus and links\n_site/ folder - this contains your rendered website - you’ll drop this folder into Netlify Drop and it will serve it.\ntheme.css - this is where you can set appearance options, such as font, font-size, and colors.\n\n\n\nHow does {distill} work?\n{distill} is what is called a static site generator. It takes Markdown and Rmarkdown and converts them to . .html files.\nMuch like any RMarkdown file, {distill} uses {knitr} and pandoc to build your website files that are contained in an RStudio Project. It knits your .Rmd files, converting them to .html files to a folder. The default name of this folder is called _site and it contains all of them files you need to upload to make a website.\n\n\nWhat is Netlify?\nNetlify is what is called a hosting service. This is a network of computers called web servers that are accessible via web addresses that will serve your website files when they are requested by a web browser.\nThe amazing thing about Netlify is that it is mostly free and it is very fast, no matter where you are (they have web servers almost everywhere).\nWe’ll use Netlify Drop to get our website files up and accessible as quickly as possible.\n\n\nCustomize your about links\nTake a look at about.Rmd and start filling out the front matter with your own links:\nlinks:\n  - label: LinkedIn\n    url: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-laderas-0714a92/\"\n  - label: Twitter\n    url: \"https://twitter.com/tladeras\"\n  - label: Portfolio\n    url: \"index.html\"\n  - label: Email\n    url: \"mailto:email@email.com\"\n\n\nAdding a photo\nAdd your photo to the images folder. Change the line in about.Rmd:\nimage: \"image/ted.jpg\"\nto the name of your file. For example, if your file is named jane.jpg and you put it in images:\nimage: \"image/jane.jpg\"\n\n\nBuilding your website using the Build Tab\nIn the top right panel in RStudio (next to Environment and History), there is a “Build” Tab.\nPress the Build Website to run knitr, which will knit your website to the _site folder. This is where your rendered content lives.\n\n\n\nBuild Website Tab\n\n\n\n\nPreviewing your website\n\nOpen the _site folder and click on the index.html file (make sure you’re viewing in web browser)\n\nThis is your main link to the website (the entry point). For example, if I was hosting my website at https://laderast.github.io/, this would be the first page that I would see.\n\nYour about page is available as about.html in the _site folder.\nClick away and make sure that everything works (links in menu, etc). If not, update the _site.yml and build it again.\n\n\n\nTry out different postcards themes\nThe postcards package has the following built in themes:\n\njolla\njolla_blue\nonofre\ntrestles - which your current site uses\n\nChange this line in your about.Rmd file to the theme of your interest and start building again:\noutput:\n  postcards::trestles\n\n\nAdd Your Rendered .html files to the articles/ folder\nYou can now add your articles to the articles/ folder.\nThere are a couple example articles here. Add your own files here.\nIn general, you’ll put knitted html articles here. Distill does not rebuild articles, it leaves that up to you.\nThe relative path to access articles is like this:\narticles/crops.html\nYou’ll use this when adding links to your menu.\n\n\nCustomize the Menu\nThe menu lives in the _site.yml file:\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"About\"\n      href: about.html\n    - text: \"Articles\"\n      menu:\n          -  text: \"dplyr::slice()\"\n             href: articles/slice.html\n          -  text: \"Crop Yields\"\n             href: articles/crops.html\nAdd another menu entry under articles, or modify the above entries to have a link to your articles.\nBuild your website again and preview it to make sure the links work.\n\n\nGetting Your Website Online\nWe’ll take the _site folder with our generated website and drop this entire folder into Netlify Drop.\nhttps://drop.netlify.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Your Website\nThe first thing you want to do is claim your site and register for a Netlify account. That ties your newly created website to your account so you can update it.\nWhen you update your website with the Build Website button, you’ll drag the _site folder onto the deploy zone. This is under the deploy tab:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info here: https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#drag-and-drop\n\n\nCustomize Your Domain\nThat crazy name is the address of your site. To change it, you can click on the Domain Settings button:\n\n\n\nDomain Settings Button\n\n\nIn the following page, click the Options &gt;&gt; Edit Site Name button. You can change the first part of the domain, such as “myportfolio.netlify.app).\n\n\n\nEdit Site Name Button\n\n\n\n\nStyling your website\nNote that this only applies to the main distill website and not the about.html, since that is styled separately.\nIn _site.yml, try uncommenting this line and seeing how the site changes.\n#theme: theme.css\nYou can modify the appearance of your website by altering the theme.css file. Much more info about this here:\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html#theming\n\n\nCreating New Websites\nIf you want to start from scratch, I highly recommend the Distill tutorial here:\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html\nYou may want to setup your webpage as a blog, which lets you add posts by date:\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog.html\n\n\nPutting your site code on GitHub\nThis is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can put your site code up on GitHub as well. This has the following advantages:\n\nLets others contribute to your website\nCan host on GitHub Pages as well\nLets others reuse your code for their own website\n\nIf you’re interested in this, I really recommend Happy Git with R as a way to get started.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThank you to RStudio for the {distill} package. It is so great!\nPortions of this tutorial are adapted from: https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html and from https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/sharing-on-short-notice-how-to-get-your-materials-online-with-r-markdown/\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2021,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted and Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {An {Introduction} to \\{Distill\\} for Websites},\n  date = {2021-03-19},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted, and Ted Laderas. 2021. “An Introduction to {Distill}\nfor Websites.” March 19, 2021."

By using a synthetic dataset, some simple dplyr commands, and a shiny dashboard, we teach graduate students how to explore their data and how to handle issues that can arise (missing values, differences in units).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Well, the first Cascadia R Conference has come and gone. I have to say that it was super fun, and well attended (over 190 people!). I had a blast meeting and chatting with everyone. Hopefully, we showed newbies that R is learnable and others that there are lots more things to learn about R.\nThe following is my attempt to document what we learned from organizing Cascadia-R. It’s not complete; I may add and subtract from it as I think of more things to say about the planning process.\nDecide the tone. Our goals with Cascadia-R were modest. We wanted to get a diverse group of R users together in a safe and encouraging environment. We wanted our workshops to be accessible to even beginners, and encourage them in the use of R.\nPart of meeting these goals of this is setting the tone. We really wanted to encourage all levels of R users to attend. All of our flyers, emails and promotional tweets encouraged beginners to come. We got help with making a Code of Conduct for the conference. Part of creating a supportive environment is encouraging diversity in both speakers and attendees. We did our best to reach out to current groups that encourage diversity, such as Women in Science Portland, and R-Ladies Global.\nWe also offered diversity scholarships to encourage people from diverse backgrounds to attend, and made diversity part of our criteria for selecting talks.\nStart planning early. As junior faculty at OHSU, I’m lucky enough to be able to book facilities here, including the large learning studios where we held the conference. Having the venue secured early on made the remaining logistics of the conference much easier.\nMuch like wedding planning, there are plenty of conference planning services out there who would be happy to take over aspects of your conference, for a fee. You can spend however much you want to on these things. However, I believe that such a approach is not financially responsible. I also feel that taking a more DIY/bespoke approach can make a conference most engaging (see csvconf). We tried to do most things ourselves (including design, promotion, talk submission, workshops, and registration/logistics).\nIterate your budget. Think of a conference as a project with lots of linked dependencies. Your first plan is probably not going to be your final plan. Start a plan, iterate, realize that things are going to shift, have a backup plan. What if registration is not going to pay for the venue rental fee? Talking to simpatico sponsors can take much of the financial stress. In our case, the Rstudio foundation and ROpenSci stepped up to contribute some money as a cushion.\nRemember, there are fixed costs (such as venue rental, and recording/streaming costs) and variable costs that scale with the number of attendees (food, badges, alcohol). Separate these out. When possible, pay off the fixed costs first, so that it’s easier to manage the variable costs.\nAgain, who is your desired audience and can they afford your conference? We decided to make our conference as affordable as possible to encourage as many different kinds of people to attend. We initially wanted to make attendance free for students. The problem with free is that literally it’s free. It has no value in the mind of a person who accepts free admission. So we decided to charge students a small fee just to emphasize that the conference has value.\nTalk with others who have done it. We were very clueless about much of the logistics side at OHSU. I managed to get through by talking with a number of people here (including Robin Champieux and Shannon McWeeney) who have done conferences here at OHSU. Thank you so much for your invaluable advice.\nEncourage each other and delegate. No one of us could have done all of the conference planning alone. Each of us took on various aspects of conference organization and brought in the others as support as needed. Some of us selected talks, some of us did design, and we all pitched in to get registration working as efficiently and quickly as possible.\nOur slack channel on pdxdata.slack.com is full of our decisions. Slack was so useful as a planning mechanism that we only met online via Google Hangouts a few times, and only had two in-person planning sessions.\nBe Willing to Make Mistakes. Lord knows I made a bunch of mistakes when I made announcements and hosted the lightning sessions. However, I owned up to these mistakes, shrugged, and moved on. Improvising in the moment can be just as important as planning.\nThink about the future. What should the next Cascadia-R look like? I know it just happened, but we’re trying to envision what it would look like. Based on the feedback we’ve gotten so far, people really want more workshops!\nIn a following post, I’m also going to talk about lessons I learned when Chester and I put on our tidyverse workshop.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2017,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Some {Lessons} {We} {Learned} {Running} {Cascadia-R} 2017},\n  date = {2017-06-07},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2017. “Some Lessons We Learned Running Cascadia-R\n2017.” June 7, 2017."

    "text": "In healthy cultures, people rise by elevating others and fall by undermining others. In toxic cultures, people are forced to choose between helping others and achieving success. Choose the workplace where success comes from making others successful. - Adam Grant\nWhen I read Adam Grant’s Give and Take, it was like a light went off. In this book, Grant gives profiles of highly successful people who are givers - people who have changed their field by making things better for others. I immediately connected to this idea of giving. Here was a way to network with people that really worked for me. Giving and connecting people are what I do best. I like to help people achieve their goals if I know someone else who can help them.\nAnd no doubt, embracing my identity as a giver has helped change my career trajectory - in the last few years, I co-founded Cascadia R, produced the R-Bootcamp with Jessica Minnier, and have met so many people in the field of education and open science that I want to work with and who have inspired me.\nHowever, as I’ve noted before, I tend to be giving to the point of being self sacrificing, which is not good. I’m reminded of the end of Kafka’s Metamorphosis when (spoilers) as Gregor Samsa dies in his bug form. As he dies, he worries about the agency of his family. Will they be able to support themselves? In the end, the family that he was worried about finds jobs, support themselves and thrive in the end. Without him. One interpretation of this story: no one is so irreplaceable in this world.\nThis Spring, I probably gave a little too much to my Health Analytics class, to the point of being self-sacrificing. This shouldn’t be a reflection of the class - they were great and really whip smart - I just tend to give a little too much. As a result, I was pretty drained by the time I got to Summer quarter. I’d definitely overdrawn on giving - I was pretty wiped out through the summer. Being overdrawn actually meant I didn’t have enough energy to teach as well as I would have liked - and I felt worse for this.\nThe lesson I’ve learned this summer: If you find yourself giving to the point of self-sacrifice, you need to ask yourself why you are sacrificing so much of yourself. Excessive self-sacrifice seems to occur when your self-esteem is tied to the perception of yourself by other people. Meaning, you should question why you are self-sacrificing. Is it because you feel like you need the approval of others? No one’s approval is worth overworking yourself over.\nSo, self-sacrifice is ultimately bullshit. Ironically, being self-sacrificing can lead to feelings of helplessness and resentment from the people you are sacrificing yourself for. Additionally, being highly proactive and championing change can actually have negative effects if your actions are perceived as a threat to your organizational culture. There’s a reason why change management is important. No one person can be a revolution - it takes others to do so. It shouldn’t fall to just being on you.\nYou need to take care of yourself and protect yourself from the takers. As Faith Harper writes in Unf#ck Your Adulting, “taking care of yourself does the world a favor”. Taking care of yourself means that you can do good in the world sustainably, and continue to do it, rather than burning out.\nUnderstand that the notion of true giving is not rooted in self-sacrifice. Giving is in the spirit of generosity; in contrast, self-sacrifice is more akin depleting one’s own resources. As a giver, your generosity should be recognized and not exploited.\nOne thing to be aware of as a giver is passion exploitation, where people and organizations will take advantage of you because of your passion for a subject as an opportunity to pay you much less than you’re worth. Such an attitude is prevalent in creative industries, where one is encouraged to work for free or “exposure” (I don’t really do soundtrack work any more because of this). As if being a poor artist or creative was a privilege. Such situations will drain your passion and your energy and burn you out with nothing to show for it. Again, you have to keep something for yourself.\nIf you want to continue to do good in the world, you must take care of yourself. This is especially the case in a toxic work culture. You have to build reserves - never give more of yourself than you can. Especially do not do this in a work setting. It is amazing how self-sacrifice can become the status-quo and what is expected of workers. No one is well off because of that. Toxic work cultures encourage this: crunch time as the norm at game studios, overwork at Japanese Black Companies, even in the non-profit sector.\nIn short, I believe in kindness and giving. But the kindness and giving must be sustainable. You must defend yourself from those who would take more than they give, and avoid being exploited by those who see your passion as something exploitable. Identifying these people and organizations and saying no is key to taking care of yourself while making things better for others. Don’t feel guilty about this. Don’t make self-sacrifice part of your identity or job description."

    "text": "I’m leaving OHSU. I have accepted a position to become a bioinformatics trainer for DNANexus. I am passionate about making sure that people do good analysis, and I’m convinced that DNANexus is the best place for me to make an impact and move away from academia.\nAs an bioinformaticist/collaborator who is focused on doing reproducible analysis, the level of financial support I received in academia was difficult to sustain. I didn’t have an R01 of my own; I was often divided between multiple projects where I was faced with the decision of having to triage work and do work I was less proud of. I was spending less time on things I’m passionate about, and more on administration, which was much less important to me. I was also split between multiple departments and meeting the expectations of everyone was way too difficult for me.\nHaving multiple bosses, I was also forced to adopt the survival strategy of not disappointing the same person in a row. I never felt good about that, and I’m tired of feeling that way. I could not see my career as being sustainable, nor did I ever consider myself someone who would be promoted in the current environment. The university did not recognize the level of collaboration that I dedicate myself to, nor does it priortize this level in terms of promotion and tenure criteria. So I never felt sure whether I was on the path to promotion.\nA lot of what I’ve tried to accomplish has been fueled by a deep anger by what happened to me during my dissertation process. My dissertation advisor was unsupportive and I had a toxic dissertation committee. But I can’t make these feelings the cornerstone of my future life.\nI’ve tried to make academia less painful through efforts such as Cascadia-R, BioData Club, and my workshops and courses. I still believe that learning should be less lonely and that fighting impostor syndrome is something that should be done in a supportive community. I will continue to be involved with both in a limited capacity.\nI will always be grateful to my students and TAs for their fresh perspectives and energy. I hope you will continue on with that enthusiasm. I hope that I have inspired you, at least in a small way. I am also grateful for all the faculty, staff, postdocs, and everyone in the open science, data science and R communities who have been supportive of me in my journey, and who have helped me arrive at this decision.\nI don’t want my decision to be an example for others. I don’t want to discourage others in their pursuit of an academic career, if that is what their heart is set on. But please be aware of the potential downfalls of such a path. The high rejection rates for funding. The low percentage of us who are destined for stable careers in academia. You need to find your own way, and you will probably do a better job of finding funding than I did. Get to independence through securing your own funding as fast as possible, or start building those marketable skills.\nIn the coming months, I will probably release less R material, due to my focus on bioinformatics training. I love R, but I have given more than I have recieved back and I need to focus on myself for the time being. I’ve depleted myself over the last year and I need to recharge. Hopefully you will respect that.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2021,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Moving {On} and {Upwards}},\n  date = {2021-04-29},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2021. “Moving On and Upwards.” April 29,\n2021."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Well, Cascadia-R 2018 has come and gone. This year we tried our best to make it as inclusive, welcoming, and friendly as we could. Considering we had 224 participants this time around, I’d say it was a success.\nI just thought I would do a little write up of some of the things we did and why we did them in our conference. I’m hoping it will be useful for other conference planners to create a welcoming environment.\n\nWe created a pull plan based on what we learned last year. Because last year was pretty chaotic in terms of planning, we decided to try to make a pull plan this year. Pull planning is a project management technique in which you work backwards from absolute deadlines (from the day of the conference). Doing so spaces out a lot of the work and makes things potentially more dividable across a group. I’ve made our pull plan public so other conference planners can see what we did and the timing it took to organize the conference.\nFind sponsorship money. We ran last year on a shoestring, using only about $3500. We realized that to make the conference more inclusive this year, we had to get sponsorship money. Childcare and diversity scholarships cost money. We wanted sponsors who had values that aligned with our inclusion goals. Lilly Winfree was especially great at finding sponsors who were in tune with what we wanted to accomplish with our conference. Sponsorship also allowed us to pay for lunch for everyone, which we couldn’t last year.\nProvide childcare. We wanted parents to be able to attend, so we got DivCare to provide childcare for them in our building. DivCare provided childcare for 8 children, and we had some grateful parents who were happy they could attend.\nDiversity Committee. We did this last year, but we had more money this year for diversity scholarships for those who might not be able to attend. I think next year we might think about reaching out to more STEM groups, but I think the real challenge is finding how to get those diverse students who might not even know about data science in and how to properly host and support them.\nGet rid of longer form talks. Keynotes and Lightning talks only. This is probably the most controversial choice that we made. However, we realized that the 10-15 minute talks we had in 2017 were mostly academic ones. Honestly, there are already too many academic conferences out there. We wanted a format that was more accessible and encouraged discussion afterwards, so we stayed with the lightning talks.\nHave keynote speakers show newcomers how to join the R Community. We chose Kara Woo and Alison Hill as our keynote speakers for a very specific reason: we wanted to encourage people new to R that they could learn things. Alison gave a wonderful talk about ways to approach learning R; Kara gave a great talk talking about how to contribute to various R-projects on GitHub, especially the tidyverse suite of packages. What I really liked about both their talks was that they emphasized learning by doing.\nMoar workshops. We wanted beginners and intermediate people feel like they were learning something, and in a safe learning environment. One piece of feedback from last year was that people wanted more workshops. We created a beginner track and an intermediate track for workshops. I would just like to say that none of the workshop people got paid for their work, and I do wish that some of the attendees realized that before they provided feedback such as “BORING” (seriously? please realize that there are people who develop these, and constructive feedback is always better). All of these workshops were done for free as labors of love, unlike conferences like ODSC.\nOrganize Volunteers. We had lots of volunteers this year and we finally were able to figure out roles for everyone to do (registration, nametags, TAs, etc).\nDo a visualization fest that wasn’t competitive. I know that everyone loves bake-offs like the DREAM Challenges and Kaggle, but we felt that having a competition was in conflict with the community building we wanted to do with the conference.That, and Tidy Tuesday, were the inspirations for the cRaggy. We wanted people to share ideas with each other and to be constructive with each other. We had three great short talks talking about their approach to the visualization and we shared the data with Tidy Tuesday.\nTalk honestly about impostor syndrome. We had a panel with three people (the wonderful Paige Bailey, Kevin Watanabe-Smith and Lilly Winfree) and they all talked about how they deal with impostor syndrome. Some of the lessons are: you feel like less of an impostor the more you do and the more you participate.\nHave more downtime. We had feedback last year that there wasn’t enough social time. We built more breaks into the schedule and had a third room (the hack room) dedicated to the “hallway track”: often the best times we’ve had conferences is when we play hooky from conference activities. Some people suggested this year that there maybe was too much downtime. I would say to that, there’s always more opportunity to meet people.\n\nSo that’s why Cascadia R was the way it was this year. In another blog post, I’ll talk more about the fun things that happened this year and our hopes for the next year.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2018,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Cascadia-R 2018: {How} We Planned It and the Reasons Why},\n  date = {2018-06-09},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2018. “Cascadia-R 2018: How We Planned It and the\nReasons Why.” June 9, 2018."

Note that the student probably wouldn’t make any friends in high places, but it would be a potentially high impact thesis.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2015,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Statcheck {Interview}},\n  date = {2015-11-19},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2015. “Statcheck Interview.” November 19,\n2015."

    "text": "I want to thank everyone who has reached out to me after I wrote my post on struggling with my depression and self-care. I am incredibly grateful for everyone’s concern about me. I wrote that at a low point in my life because I had to. I was suffering too long in silence, and I needed to do something. Writing that post was incredibly scary. I am still worried that it may be used against me somehow down the line when I am reviewed for tenure. But the truth is that I’m not a productivity machine; I can be extremely dependable in very uncertain situations, but to do that I need support.\nI wanted to start the conversation because mental health is not something we talk about much in academia. There is still a lot of bias and stigma against those with mental illness, that they are “weak”, or that they should “get out of academia”. This stigma prevents a lot of students and postdocs from seeking the treatment they need. I just want to say this to everyone who is struggles with mental illness: you aren’t weak, and you aren’t alone. As far as I am concerned, each of you that manages to get through your day despite of your illness should be considered a hero. Because I know how hard it can be to even get out of bed some days. And I would like for PIs to consider that your overall neglect and/or bad advising can contribute to your student’s decline in mental health.\nThank you to all my students, my colleagues, alumni, and everyone in my department (including my department head and division head) who are supporting me. Your kindness and sharing your stories about your struggles really has meant a lot to me. I’ve come to realize that I have an amazing support network and that I just need to ask for help. I am slowly figuring out what that help is. I’m going to 0.8 time for a while to give me more breathing room. I’m exhausted and I just need some time to replenish my energy and reflect where I want to go next.\nI have come to realize that saying yes when I shouldn’t comes at a cost to myself and my mental health. Everything I do comes at a cost; I need to have a better gauge of when that cost is worth it, and how much mental reserve I have in my tanks. When my collaborators don’t understand the amount of work I do cleaning their data, when they don’t respect the work I have done managing their data and reconciling the issues with data collection, that’s when I feel like working in research is not worth it.\nOne of my industry collaborations was like that, and it pretty much drained nearly all of my energy. I don’t like working with people who expect me to give them an answer and aren’t willing to educate me about what I’m supposed to be looking for. I also don’t like working with people who take advantage of my work in open science to further their own work agenda. I need less of these kind of collaborations, and I need the gumption to walk away from them.\nI just want to say this: I am not a rock. I am not strong. But I am a good advocate for others, especially those I feel who have been dealt an unfair hand. I realize that I need to advocate for myself right now. Thank you to other academics such as Dr. Emily Hencken Ritter, who wrote about her struggles with depression and what help she asked for. I’m going to highlight posts about this using the hashtag #DepressionInAcademia on Twitter.\nIn short: I’m not going to get better overnight, but I’m trying to take steps to get better. I’ll be taking a little time off this summer as well to recharge and figure out what’s next. I’ll try to chronicle what works for me and to highlight other people’s writings about this.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2018,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Asking for Help to Get Better},\n  date = {2018-06-25},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2018. “Asking for Help to Get Better.” June\n25, 2018."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: I have some misgivings about posting this, but I’m hoping it will help others to realize that they’re not defined by their parents. Not everyone is blessed to have good parents.\nWhen my dad died in March, one of his relatives I notified called me “a bad son” and that I owed him more.\nTo that, I ask, what does it mean to be a good son to a bad dad?\nOur relationship was complicated. My dad was a textbook narcissist, and his siblings all resented him for the special treatment he got from his father. The more I have learned about narcissism, the more I think his life was sad, but also the more I am aware of the damage he did to the rest of my family.\nNarcissists thrive on making others feel bad, because it’s a power move that makes them feel better. But underneath it all lies a very insecure and emotionally stunted person who lashes out. They need external validation, and to be adored. Inevitably, they burn bridges and lose relationships.\nI remember him saying that the reason to go to college was to learn how to manipulate people.\nI remember him gaslighting me, making me unsure of myself.\nThe only way to “win” with narcissists is to not play their games, and we have to protect ourselves, whether that be to leave them, grey rock them, or emotionally armor ourselves from their criticism.\nTo answer the question, I think that my dad provided a counter example of what I didn’t want to become. I think that’s the only way to be good son in this situation.\nMy number one value is kindness. But my number two value, learned the hard way, is self-preservation. I don’t have to be vulnerable or share parts of my life to people who would weaponize it against me.\nSo next time you criticize someone for being a bad family member for not being present, know that it’s probably a survival mechanism. That your criticism and shaming is enabling the narcissistic cycle to begin again.\nI have blocked those negative family members from my life. They can take their criticism elsewhere."

    "text": "Note: I am not writing the following to complain, or excuse any past behavior. I am writing this just to be honest and transparent about my current struggles in academia. I hope it helps someone, or encourages other to seek help.\n\nI have to confess that I haven’t really been feeling all that well the past few months. Right now I am plagued with feelings that I am doing my work as an Assistant Professor wrong. I struggle with this persistent voice in my head that even when I am working at full tilt and beyond, that it’s not enough.\nFor most of my life, I have had chronic depression. I am a high functioning depressive; I have managed to get things done when I am depressed. However, this effort comes at the cost of self-care. I really think that some past posts have really come from a place of high stress and high anxiety. I apologize for the harsh tone of this post. I am also struggling with burnout at this point. I am beginning to feel like a lot of my efforts to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations are not feeling very productive. Part of this has to do with internal politics.\nI don’t think my depression is an excuse for my past behavior. The lack of self-care, however, is a major cause. When I don’t take care of myself, I reach a place of high stress and high anxiety and I can’t think straight. If I have been hurtful or bullying to others in any way because of this, I apologize.\nI still struggle with impostor syndrome. I do think that in many ways, this struggle has helped me become more compassionate as a teacher, remembering what concepts I struggled with. I have been trying my best to keep up with the added responsibilities of a faculty member: mentoring students, writing new course material, doing outreach, and also trying to keep the lights on by doing research (I won’t get into grant writing here; that’s another major depressive kettle of fish). I feel like I’ve currently been a disappointment as a faculty member so far.\nI am currently in therapy, which has been very helpful in understanding what problems I can address and what problems that are currently endemic to the academic system. I don’t know of any other field where one can accomplish a lot yet still feel like a failure.\nThe hardest thing for me is saying no, especially to students. But I realize that I can’t really be my best for students without taking care of myself. That balance between being considerate of others and also being considerate of my self is something that I am struggling with as a faculty member.\nI guess my point being is that I need to reframe saying no as being protective of myself and my current students rather than registering the disappointment when I say no. I’d like to help people, but I can help people better when I’m feeling well and better. Part of this may be coming to grips that academia may not be my place in the world if it demands that I sacrifice my mental health just to stay where I am.\nSo for the time being, I’d like to focus on getting better and feeling better. For your sake and mine. I will try to welcome newcomers to data science the best I can - just realize that what I may be able to do for you is a little limited right now.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2018,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {Self {Care} and {Self} {Compassion} in {Academia}},\n  date = {2018-06-05},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2018. “Self Care and Self Compassion in\nAcademia.” June 5, 2018."

DNAnexus has a very collaborative culture and there is not that much distance between new employees and senior employees. I also never liked the hierarchy between PhDs and non-PhDs, and there is very little condescension here.\nMy desire and passion to onboard students has directly translated to training in industry. There is a need for developing training that uses active learning techniques, and our customers want it. Not all of them are highly technical and used to the cloud, and it is an exciting challenge trying to help them learn what they need to learn.\nThere is program management. One of the worst things about being paid under multiple grants was that the sum total of my work was not visible. Everyone was always expecting everything, all the time. I really like how program management here helps to balance everyone’s workload and help them avoid burnout.\nRoles and responsibilities are specialized. I like this as one of the best benefits. I don’t have to wear all the hats, so I can specialize and get better at my specialty. I really want to help develop a kick-ass training plan to get more people working efffectively on our platform.\nBeing a beginner really helps in developing training. I have to confess that I haven’t stayed 100% on top of the cutting edge of bioinformatics. I am well versed in high performance computing, but transitioning to cloud computing has had a pretty high learning curve.\nCulture is a positive force and drives almost everything. Management, including PeopleOps (our version of HR) has been aware that the pandemic has increased productivity, but also that burnout has been increasing. They’ve been trying to be aware of this and instituting blackout days where the office is closed, encouraging employees to unplug. A lot of my understanding of organizations has helped me realize that this is a pretty positive place.\nPay and benefits are definitely better than academia. The pay increase is considerable, since they actually value your contributions."

The first two weeks here were dedicated to a very extensive onboarding process. Every quarter, we have a Bootcamp for new employees, and it is about 2 weeks of classes, where we meet people from each team, and learn about the platform. It’s a pretty hardcore onboarding process, which was pretty overwhelming. On the plus side, I have a big picture of how the parts work together and who to ask for help.\nYou are specialized and part of a larger plan. I am part of the service organization within DNAnexus, which helps customers implement and utilize the platform effectively. I work with customers who need training, and we provide a set of coursework to get them onboard the platform. This means that my work is always in the context of the organization, and that thinking about my work as billable is important to achieving our goals as an organization.\nThe pace is faster than academia. Projects need to be in the context of the overall strategy of the organization. If you can pitch in, you can do some neat things. But your time is valuable, so you have to spend your time wisely.\n\nIn all, was the transition what I expected? I would say yes, but it’s not for everyone. I think that overall, my emotional intelligence serves me much better in the current position than it has in academia, where it was just a way for others to mindlessly take advantage of me. My desire to be a respectful collaborator has served me well so far.\nDefinitely do your research and ask the hard questions if you are making the switch. And find other people who are thinking about making the change, and ask others who have made the switch. You will need their support."

    "text": "Lessons Learned\nOverall, we believe the workshop went well, as it encouraged discussion about data and its appropriateness among the students. Students were engaged overall and asked lots of questions.\nThe final reports for each group were generated from a R Notebook. All three groups showed a thoughtful narrative and justification for each of the covariates included in the model.\n\nInteractive visualization removes barriers to understanding issues in data. Ted developed a Shiny App that allowed the students to visually browse and understand the data. Along with the EDA scavenger hunt (see below), this served as a good introduction for students to get their feet wet with the SHHS dataset.\nOur diverse backgrounds helped make the workshop accessible. Nicole Weiskopf has a background in data quality of clinical data, Eilis Boudreau does sleep study work, and I’m a bit of a mongrel.\nSecuring the cooperation of the data holders made the workshop possible. The dataset comes from the National Sleep Study Resource. Eilis knows Susan Redline, who heads that group and pitched the idea (over two sessions) to her group. Susan’s group was very enthusiastic and helpful, especially in helping the students get their data use agreements in so they could access the dataset.\nGroup work is learning work. We assigned each student to a group, and gave each group questions to answer and teach the class about the dataset. By pointing them to specific aspects of the data, we opened the door to discussion.\nEDA scavenger hunt. We had the students learn data exploration by giving them a scavenger hunt to look at the relationship between variables. Each group was then required to talk about their findings and which visualization helped them discover that relationship. For example, there is a relationship between age and race in our dataset; the “Other” category of race has a lower median age than the other two categories, “White” and “Black”.\nDidactic Teaching is also important. Nicole and Eilis covered both the biology of sleep apnea and the difficulty of understanding the implications of clinical data. Without this background, students would not be able to make informed decisions about their final model.\nGuide the Students, but don’t force discussion. This was important. We think the students need to connect the dots to really understand the issues. The final product (a logistic regression model predicting cardiovascular disease with an R Notebook) had steps and choices. But the choices for each group of students was different.\nA Code of conduct is necessary and important. We are big believers in psychological safety. If people don’t feel safe in the classroom environment (and let’s face it, grad school classrooms rarely are), they will be less likely to learn and contribute.\nData restrictions made deploying difficult. The activity materials were deployed as an RStudio project. However, we couldn’t share the data within a GitHub repo. As OHSU’s approved vendor is Box, we setup a box folder containing the material to be shared with students.\n\nWe were grateful for the incoming informatics students’ enthusiasm and patience as we got this workshop going. Also thanks to the NLM T15 Supplement in Data Science, without which we would not have gotten the opportunity to conceptualize, put together, and deliver this workshop. Thanks again to Susan Redline and the National Sleep Research Resource group, especially Dan Mobley who helped us with the last-minute data use agreements.\nLink to Workshop: https://github.com/laderast/clinical_data_wrangling"

    "text": "I’m still in the process of recovering from my current bout of depression and anxiety. I’d like to talk about what is currently helping me moderate my anxiety. I have been practicing mindfulness and meditation for the past three years and I’m beginning to realize how necessary it is in our information dense age. Many of my symptoms of anxiety are really from an information overglut.\nI’m currently on way too many projects and am teaching as well. Everything wants my attention. We need to decide dates for a visit, etc. Booking travel, grading students, etc. The noise of academic life can be overwhelming and can prevent me from working effectively. A book I’m reading, Real Happiness at Work by Sharon Salzberg, talks about Attention Deficit Trait disorder:\nThis is especially prevalent for people like me who are on multiple grants and have many collaborators. I’m okay with putting out the occasional fire or dealing with an emergency deadline; if I believe in the project, I can muster the energy. However, the problem is when I have multiple fires to deal with from multiple people. The task switching leads to stress and leads to an inability to prioritize. This is where I’ve been the last few months.\nAnd this is when the voices of doubt begin to fuel my anxiety. On top of the enormous task list, there’s the feelings of failure and disappointment because I can’t get simple things done. In my head the voices reach a frenzy, a cacophony, a noise. And then I can’t think straight, prioritize, work on one thing.\nWhat is the solution to ADT and the noise of life? Mindfulness and unitasking. As Sharon Salzberg notes:\nThis idea (being a master of my environment) appeals to me in the midst of my academic anxiety. Practicing mindfulness (through daily meditation) helps me to focus on the here and now. We are wired to ruminated about the past (things we wish we’d done better) or the future (oh crap, I need to prepare upcoming stuff). Meditation is all about building that focus and attention on what’s before us. If we can’t do it all, we can at least work on what’s right in front of us.\nI’ve also been reading Anne Lamott’s Bird by Bird, a book reflecting on the hows and whys of writing and living your life while doing it. It’s a sobering view of why we write and how to keep on in the face of numerous adversities. There’s one passage that really resonated with me in the chapter called “Shitty First Drafts” in dealing with the incessant chatter of life:\nThis is another idea in mindfulness: welcoming and acknowledging our worries and negative voices. If we ignore or refuse these feelings, they just become stronger and louder in the din and the noise. I have all sorts of these feelings: I don’t work hard enough, I’m a failure, I’m letting down people who depend on me, Everyone is out there working on cooler things than me. Now I’m trying to take an effort to welcome these feelings into my mental space, saying “okay, I hear you and acknowledge you, so you don’t have to be yelling anymore”. And surprisingly, they do quiet down. Acknowledging the feelings of failure, thanking them for their contribution to the discussion and showing them the door is important. As Kelly Boys says in The Blind Spot Effect:\nAnd that helps lower the volume and free your attention.\nIf you are feeling generalized anxiety or attention deficit trait, I encourage you to look into mindfulness as a way of turning down the noise."

    "text": "Very interesting New York Times article about the rise of frauds and retractions in High Impact Factor journals. The retraction rates for High IF journals (such as Science, Cell, and Nature) are much higher than lower IF journals.\nFrom the article:\n\nJournals with higher impact factors retract papers more often than those with lower impact factors. It’s not clear why. It could be that these prominent periodicals have more, and more careful, readers, who notice mistakes. But there’s another explanation: Scientists view high-profile journals as the pinnacle of success — and they’ll cut corners, or worse, for a shot at glory.\n\nI would say that this is sad, but this is a consequence of the currently terrible funding climate and unreasonable expectations of study sections. If study sections dismiss grant writers because of an unreasonable expectation of past productivity, then it shouldn’t be surprising that the drive to make oneself look productive actively encourages fraud to get ahead.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2015,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {High {Impact} {Factor} {Journals} {Have} {Higher}\n    {Retraction} {Rates}},\n  date = {2015-05-24},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2015. “High Impact Factor Journals Have Higher\nRetraction Rates.” May 24, 2015."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Have you ever had something that no matter how many times someone explained it, you really had no idea what it was for? For me, that was Non Standard Evaluation (NSE) in R, and its newer cousin Tidy Evaluation, or tidyeval. I had a real learning block about it. I really wanted to understand it, but for some reason I just really wasn’t getting the general concepts.\nWhat is evaluation, really? For the longest time, I was extremely confused about it. When you provide an expression to R such as:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rlang)\nthis_variable &lt;- 2\nthis_variable * 6\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nYou notice that there is an output to this_variable * 6, which is 12. Evaluation is really about looking up variable names in an environment and then acting on the results. What is going on here is that R looks for an object that is named this_variable in our global environment, and then returns the value, 2, which it then substitutes in the expression. So our original expression:\n\nthis_variable * 6\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nBecomes this expression:\n\n2 * 6\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nWhich R knows how to calculate, the output of which is 12. But sometimes you want to pass an expression or a variable, as is, without evaluating it first. The best case for this is to passing a variable into a function. We can do this by wrapping them up in quosures or enquosures.\n\n\nA quosure and an enquosure can be thought of as envelopes around an object. They obscure certain properties of the object until they can be delivered into a function. The envelopes basically are a way to sneak variables and expressions into a function’s environment. When the envelope is in the function, we can open it up and evaluate what’s in the envelope. The trick to NSE and tidyeval is that we can control when the function evaluates the expression, by controlling when we open this envelope. We do this by using the UQ() or !! functions.\nIn other words, quosures and enquosures are ways to prevent R from looking up a variable’s value in our current environment (usually the global environment), and delay this lookup until we get them into the environment of interest. This might be one level down (in our function of interest), or several levels down (in a function called by our function).\nThe point is, R won’t open the envelope with our variable in it until we tell it to."

    "section": "",
    "text": "At some point in your life in Data Science, you will probably struggle with impostor syndrome. We all do - in fact, even though I have used R and have done bioinformatics and data science for more than 15 years, I still struggle with this feeling. As a beginner, the mountain you must climb to master skills in data science seems like a long and impossible one.\nCaitlin Hudon, in her post about dealing with impostor syndrome has this to say about countering impostor syndrome:\nI think it’s important to try and reframe the feelings of impostor syndrome into something more positive. I think having self-compassion about the difficulties of the learning process can help.\nGeorge Leonard’s Mastery is a short book that I think can help provide the antidote to these feelings of fraud and inadequacy. I feel that beginners and learners would feel much better if their instructors would own up to their own personal shortcomings as learners. That is, instead of trying to project the image of the all knowledgable guru, instructors should show themselves as humble, lifelong learners as well.\nIn Mastery, Leonard talks about our unrealistic expectations and how these expectations can get in the way of actually learning and mastering a craft. We are conditioned by ads, movies, and social media that mastering a craft is a never ending set of ever rising climaxes (cue the training montage), that we can make continuous and steady progress by working hard enough.\nMastering a craft takes practice, and lots of it. We must learn to be contented to practice when we are on a plateau and are not making visible progress. As Leonard notes,\nLeonard outlines 5 principles that can sustain us in our road to mastery and away from impostor syndrome: Instruction, Practice, Surrender, Intentionality, and The Edge. I’m trying to map common feelings of impostor syndrome and show how these principles can counteract these feelings.\nInstruction. Leonard emphasizes the importance in finding good instructors and good mentorship that will help us to grow. Finding good instructors can actually be difficult and finding someone who remembers what it was like to be learning something is important. Avoid those instructors who say things like “it should now be obvious” or are disparaging when you don’t understand something.\nWhat you can do today: look at twitter and other forums for your community of learners and support those who give good instruction. Realize that not all teachers are good teachers; leave them and seek better ones if necessary.\nPractice. Practice for practices’ sake. Deliberate practice where you slowly build up your understanding and perceptions is important to your growth.\nWhat you can do today: Join communities of practice such as Tidy Tuesday and share your learning with others. Tidy Tuesday is extremely friendly and encouraging for beginners. Learn together and grow together. These are safe communities to share knowledge.\nIntentionality. This goes hand in hand with practice. Deliberate practice requires visualizing your process and guiding yourself gently.\nWhat you can do today: find small exercises and projects that help you reinforce what you’ve learned so far. Find people’s code and vignettes and modify them until you understand what they’ve done and how they structured their work.\nSurrender. At some point, you will have to give up your own social position as an expert to grow as a learner. When this happens, you must be willing to risk that standing to progress further. Leonard talks about a karate master learning aikido who was not willing to start from scratch, which impeded his learning. For many of us academics, being willing to abandon the comfort of what we have learned is especially difficult. We feel like we are risking our own social standing and reputation.\nWhat you can do today: be humble when faced with new concepts (for many impostor syndrome sufferers this is not the hard part). Recognize when you need to grow and when you have to leave old concepts behind.\nThe Edge. This is where things are undefined and scary. Still, part of the journey to mastery is a willingness to push your thoughts to beyond the horizon of what you thought was possible.\nWhat you can do today: Identify some goals that are just beyond your current skillset and be willing to push your learning to that point.\nLeonard maintains that true mastery is not due to innate talent. True mastery is due to tenacity and perserverance in the face of difficult learning. In fact, he suggests that learning things too easily means that you might lack perserverance when the going gets rough and your progress slows. He maintains that someone who perseveres will “have learned whatever [they] are practicing to the marrow of [their] bones.”"

    "section": "Encouraging Mastery as a Community",
    "text": "Encouraging Mastery as a Community\nI think Caitlin’s prescriptions for community wide suggestions for reducing impostor syndrome are wonderful. Especially the advice to “Get comfortable with I don’t know”. Normalizing “I don’t know” within a community is incredibly important to making a psychologically safe learning environment.\nTo encourage learners, I think that creating a community of practice and helpfulness is vitally important to give new learners the support they need. When communities take responsibility for the learning of their members, something magic happens. Learning no longer feels lonely and there is no shame when you don’t immediately grasp a concept. Patience becomes the norm and people become more confident.\nFor me, this is the true value of schools and universities. To get the most out of online learning, you need to participate within a community that encourages you to learn further. Be on the pathway to mastery by participate within learning communities."

    "title": "What We learned teaching Python to Neuroscience Students",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Well, the week of teaching our Python Bootcamp for Neuroscientists is over. I had the pleasure of working with a great group of students, professors and instructors in developing the material, and had a great time teaching complete beginners to programming and Python.\nWe had the overall goal of introducting 21 Neuroscience Graduate Program students at OHSU to the basics of programming in Python using data that they were interested in: electrophysiology data, and confocal microscopy data. The course was designed to be a 1 credit course to encourage students to persist and finish it.\nThe format of the class was spread over 5 days (2.5 hours a day) and had the following schedule:\n\nIntroduction to basic data types in Python\nIntroduction to for loops and Pandas DataFrames\nUsing Pandas to analyse electrophysiology data\nUsing NumPy to analyse confocal microscopy data\nEvaluation of students; installing Python/Juypter; wrap-up with questions.\n\nI’ll just write up some random thoughts about our experiences about the course. We are definitely planning to give the course again next year, given the enthusiastic reception.\n\nThings that really worked well\nAvoid the first day blues of installing Python by using JupyterHub. I think one of the major pain points for beginners is installing software before they can even learn. Instead of making them install Python the first day, we had them sign into an AWS server that had JuypterHub deployed. JupyterHub is a multi-user server for Juypter Notebooks which had the right version of Python and our need the dependencies installed. So our students just needed a laptop and a web browser to access our lessons. We could update the notebooks by pulling changes from our course repo.\nStephen David, my fellow instructor, figured a lot of the difficult deployment details out. He has put together some handy instructions about deploying JuypterHub to AWS and keeping the accounts updated via a GitHub repo in case other people are interested in using our bootcamp materials.\nMake the atmosphere welcoming to beginners. In order to do so, we used many great tips from Software/Data Carpentry: modeling resilience by using live coding (and making mistakes along the way), using post-it notes for students to signal when they need help or are finished, and having plenty of TAs per student (at least 4 students/TA or instructor). We tried to emphasize that learning programming is an ongoing process, and that even we still have to Google errors on Stack Overflow. Showing that you can make mistakes and still recover is a big part of that.\nPlan some early wins and make the exercises as interactive as possible. For the most part, we tried to avoid lecturing too long and break up the session with interactive exercises. I also really don’t like workshops where the trainer/teacher moves on no matter whether people understand the material or not. By using the post-its to signal when they were done, we were able to more appropriately pace the workshop. We also planned on stopping points if we couldn’t get through the day’s materials.\nEmphasize working together and building a community. From the beginning, we emphasized that everyone needed to work together. I always emphasize the chain of help: 1) First your programming partner, 2) then the TA help. Discussing and working on issues together fosters a sense of community. I think there will be a group of students who will really want to learn more because of this.\nGetting feedback along the way. I still feel like being a teacher is about 75% preparation and 25% improvisation. You need to be flexible enough to come up with examples on the fly, and you need to evaluate whether students are getting the material along the way. The exercises we tried to sprinkle throughout the notebooks helped us understand where people were stumbling.\nPlanning follow-up sessions. Through BioData Club, we’re planning some follow-up sessions. Through DataCamp in the Classroom, I also got our students premium access. We also pointed students out to other Python-based courses at OHSU.\n\n\nSome things we could improve on\nI believe that given our time frame, we couldn’t really have anticipated many of these issues. We did our best to deal with them in the moment, however.\nDescribing the difference between Jupyter Notebooks and Python. At the beginning, we glossed over what a Jupyter Notebook was and really didn’t describe its relation to Python. I think next time we will open with describing the relationship between Jupyter and Python with a diagram, and revisit it on the last day.\nAnticipate the JupyterHub server requirements better. On Day 3, we had a large dataset that basically hosed the server because 21 students were trying to open it up at once. We managed to recover by getting another AWS server and dividing the students among the two, but we could have stress tested that day a little more. Lesson learned.\nGoing slowly enough. I am a very excitable teacher, to the point of which sometimes I go a little too fast. I have to confess that I may have sped through some of the material a little too fast. As a result, some of the students didn’t quite get what functions like enumerate() were for and the concept of unpacking a list. Luckily, Brad Buran covered these on Day 4 and the students felt comfortable enough to finish the programming test on the final day.\nSetting student expectations. It’s vital to show the students that they can learn programming, but also what’s possible if they do. One of the days was a big leap from the previous day, but we did mention that it’s really to show them what’s possible if they continued to learn about programming.\n\n\nWould we do it again?\nI would definitely say yes! We had to waitlist some students who really wanted to take it, and our overall feedback about the course was really positive. I hope that we can have more TAs, and have the future data workshops be more student driven.\n\n\nAcknowlegements\nThis was a collaboration between the Neuroscience Graduate Program (NGP) and the Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology (DMICE).\nThe NGP students involved in designing and testing the material were\n\nDaniela Saderi\nLucille Moore\nCharles Heller\nZack Schwartz\n\nFaculty/Instructors involved were:\n\nBrad Buran (Research Instructor)\nStephen David (NGP Assistant Professor)\nLisa Karstens (DMICE Assistant Professor)\nMichael Mooney (DMICE Assistant Professor)\nTed Laderas (DMICE Assistant Professor)\n\nThanks very much to Gary Westbrook (Director of the NGP program), Shannon McWeeney (Head of the Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology within DMICE), and Bill Hersh (Head of DMICE).\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2018,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {What {We} Learned Teaching {Python} to {Neuroscience}\n    {Students}},\n  date = {2018-01-17},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2018. “What We Learned Teaching Python to\nNeuroscience Students.” January 17, 2018."

With the webR-quarto extension, you can now run shiny apps in the browser.\nTheir behavior is not quite like running Shiny from your computer or Shiny Server; ShinyWebR apps don’t really have their own filesytem as of yet. Similarly, you need to install packages using webr::install()to install the web assembly compiled packages rather than install.packages().\nA lot of changes in the tidyverse were evolutionary. One welcome change in dplyr was to the group_by()/summarize() pattern. summarize() now supports a {data.table} like syntax for grouping so you don’t have to ungroup() at the end.\nGitHub Copilot is now available in RStudio/Posit Team."

Here are a few highlights:\n\nJadey Ryan had the very last timeslot, but made the most of it by talking about parametrized quarto reports, with conditional code blocks\nLibby Heeren gave a great lightning talk about making Data Friends and how co-working together is an easy way to make data friends\nMarcos Huerta implemented a web app in three different Python Frameworks: Shiny for Python, Streamlit, and Plotly Dash. It was really cool to compare what was easy and what was hard.\nLydia Gibson gave a great talk about the R for Data Science group and\n\nWe had a nice reception at three dots and a dash, a Tiki Speakeasy, and it was great to meet so many of the the DSH people in person, like Daniel Sjoberg and Travis Gerke."

Writing and researching it has been an amazing journey, serving as an excuse to reconnect with lots of people (Kate Hertweck, Julia Stewart-Lowndes, Jon Harmon) and meet an amazing group of community organizers and pick their brains for my talk. Through talking with them, I discovered three themes that I based my talk around: Self Care, Building a Core Group, and Making Your Meetup Welcoming.\nParallel to researching the talk was writing the talk which I did with some coaching from Articulation, which was provided to all speakers. It took me on an amazing journey, with several other speakers, from formulating the essential question to the final presentation. I decided to do something risky and make hand-drawn slides, which I was afraid would be too simplistic, but I heard connected with the majority of people.\nAs for giving the talk, I was nervous, but the session was really supportive and low-key. I’m happy with how it went, and how it was a nice journey from researching and conceiving the talk to giving it. It was a pleasure to share a session with Riva, Kari, and Millie, all sharing their data science experiences and learning along the way. I especially loved Kari’s talk about how Black Hair is like Data Science (both complex, and [require some care to untangle] and show their true form). She’s always an inspiring speaker. Riva gave a talk about how R-Ladies Global is moving forward, becoming more modular, to support the core members and avoid burnout. Finally, Millie gave a talk about starting her blog\nMore this year, I’ve felt connected to the new users of R and I want to see them do amazing things. And I’m grateful that I’m invited to go along with them on their journey. I plan on giving more talks like this where I plan on interviewing people. I never thought I’d like qualitative research, but it fits me."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: after posting this, I heard back from Roberto Tyley, the creator of the BFG. I’d like to note that the BFG actually does its job really well. I was mostly really frustrated about how Git/GitHub doesn’t prevent a user from doing something that’s hard to undo. So my frustration is really about that, not really about the BFG. This post has been edited to reflect that.\nGreg Wilson first said it, but I’ve come to agree. Git is an aggressively antisocial piece of software. Git is a piece of software that can make developers with any amount of experience feel dumb.\nRecently, I accidentally checked a large file (greater than 100 Megs) into my local repo. When I tried to push to GitHub, of course, it refused it (I know about git large file storage, but I don’t have any).\nSo my local repo was screwed up. Of course, I did what seemed like the rational thing and deleted the file from my repo and recommitted. More than once. This is a mistake I’ve done more than once. So you need to scrub your git history with BFG so that GitHub will accept your lowly commits again.\nThe BFG documentation specifies how to fix a remote repo. I would say that this situation is much less common than the local situation. So I just decided to share how I got the BFG to work for the local repo situation.\nI usually install the BFG through homebrew, using brew install bfg. When you install it this way, you can just run BFG with bfg. You can download it from the website, but you’ll have to call java -jar bfg[VERSION].jar to run it.\nSay you’ve accidently checked in a large file into your current repo. The first thing to do is to clone your local repo:\ngit clone --mirror local_repo\nThis will create another folder called local_repo.git that you will do all the BFG magic on. This local_rep.git is what is called a bare repo. I want to remove any files larger than 100 Megs, so I do this:\nbfg -b 100M local_repo.git\nIf this doesn’t return an error, you can move on. However, I got the dreaded error:\nWarning : no large blobs matching criteria found in packfiles - \ndoes the repo need to be packed?\nAugh. Ok, some googling later I found that I needed to pack my orignal repo:\ncd local_repo\ngit repack\nOkay, we need to get rid of our cloned repo and redo the last few steps.\nrm -rf local_repo.git\ngit clone --mirror local_repo\nbfg -b 100M local_repo.git\nThen comes some git commands that no one has bothered to explain to me (UPDATE: I forgot to add changing directories into local_repo.git - sorry about that!).\ncd local_repo.git\ngit reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive\ngit push\nUh oh, I get a remote: error: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/master error! More ugh.\nHere’s the trick. Since you cloned a local repo, you need to set the origin of your current repo (local_repo.git) to the GitHub remote. Still in our local_repo.git directory, first we remove the current origin, and then add back our remote.\ngit remote rm origin\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/laderast/remote_repo\nFinally, after much gnashing of the teeth, we can\ngit push\nDon’t forget to remove your now dirty local_repo, and the mirrored copy, and then pull a fresh copy down!\n##remove both original local repo and altered bare repo\nrm -rf local_repo\nrm -rf local_repo.git\n##clone a fresh copy from GitHub\ngit clone https://github.com/laderast/remote_repo\nThis may be obvious to the 10 people in the world who have read all of the git documentation, but I am not one of them. I’m stuck with git, unfortunately. I’m writing this post to remind me of what to do when I innocently do something like commit a large file to my repo.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laderas2018,\n  author = {Laderas, Ted},\n  title = {So {You’ve} {Accidentally} {Checked} in a {Large} {File}\n    {Into} {Git}},\n  date = {2018-01-05},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaderas, Ted. 2018. “So You’ve Accidentally Checked in a Large\nFile Into Git.” January 5, 2018."

    "text": "Making your tutorial mybinder.org ready\nIn short, you’ll need 3 files to make your learnr tutorial mybinder.org ready: a runtime.txt, a install.R, and a postBuild file in order to make your learnr package compatible with mybinder.org. Let’s go through the steps:\nStep 1. Specify a runtime.txt file in your root folder. You’ll need a file called runtime.txt that contains a single line:\nr-3.6-2020-08-01\nThis gives mybinder.org the signal that the Docker image needs to have R installed. You can see that I specified a version (3.6) and a snapshot date (2020-08-01). These should be a valid version and date for the snapshot - check the MRAN pages for more info: https://mran.microsoft.com/\nNote: When R 4.0 and greater is available in MRAN, you should move to it. It includes RStudio Package Manager, which installs the binary images rather than installing from source code which speeds up building the Docker images by quite a bit.\nAnother Note: I tried to get this to work with a Dockerfile using the rocker/binder images, but I couldn’t get this image to work. If anyone has gotten this working, I’d appreciate you sharing how you did it.\nStep 2. Specify package dependencies using install.R in your root folder - in this file, you’ll need to specify all the packages your tutorial is dependent on using install.packages() commands. Here’s the contents of my install.R file:\ninstall.packages(\"learnr\")\ninstall.packages(\"here\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nNote: getting the dependencies right in package building can be major headaches to getting your binder container to work. You may have to specify some system dependencies in your apt.txt file for certain packages. This information is available here: https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements\nStep 3. Specify moving the tutorials in inst/tutorials/ to the repository root folder using the postBuild folder. These commands are run after the container is built and will make the tutorials accessible via Binder.\nFor example, for the tidyowl package, I have these mv commands in my postBuild:\nmv inst/tutorials/learning_tidyselect/ .\nmv inst/tutorials/learning_rowwise/ .\nYou’ll need a mv line for each tutorial that your package contains.\n\nNote: Using holepunch\nI believe you can also use holepunch to make setup a little easier. https://github.com/karthik/holepunch\nI haven’t tried it yet, but will update this when I do."

Then click the “Launch” button.\nNow your container will build. Note that this will take a little while (10+ minutes), especially if you need to install something like tidyverse. Note that this can be one of the hardest steps to get going, especially if you need packages such as sf (see above for a link to system dependencies).\n\nWhen it’s done building, you’ll be at a Jupyter page. Click “New &gt;&gt; RStudio” to open up your image with RStudio.\n\nYou should see that your tutorial folders have been moved to the root folders. This is good confirmation that the mv statements of postBuild work. I personally like to have individual data/ folders in each tutorial, as it makes making them a little easier to deploy.\nTest out running the tutorial by going to the .Rmd file and running it.\n\nIf you’ve setup everything right, you should see your learnr tutorial popup.

    "text": "I am a bioinformatics trainer for DNANexus, formerly an Assistant Professor in Biomedical Informatics at OHSU. I train bioinformaticians how to use the DNAnexus cloud-based platform. This includes giving webinars for the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform. I am also a Data Science Mentor for Posit Academy, helping data apprenctices learn the tidyverse.\nCollaboration, training, and team science are passions of mine. I believe that research should not be lonely, and building communities of practice in science and research that are psychologically safe and inclusive are the key to doing better, more robust science. To this end, I use evidence based pedagogy, especially utilizing the concepts of psychological safety and active learning. I am a certified instructor for both The Carpentries and Posit Academy.\nMy free Ready for R course currently is at over 1800 external users, and I have built a learning community around it. The course has been lauded by users as being more inclusive and less intimidating than other R courses.\nNote: I am no longer on Twitter. The Twitter link goes to an archive of my tweets, including my most popular ones."
