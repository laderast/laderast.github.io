# <span class="c18">Retrospective and Themes for 2022</span>

<span class="c0">Ted Laderas</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">2022 was a fairly busy year for me, not just with Academy engagements, but also in outreach and working on improving the user experience with effective workshops, courses, and developing optimal workflows for getting the main tasks on the platform done. </span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">I've achieved this by observing user experiences and questions from the UKB RAP community, and from questions customers have asked during training sessions.</span>

## <span class="c19">Improving User Experience Through Establishing Best Practices</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">One of my major passions in my work is to improve the overall user experience of the DNAnexus platform by establishing and suggesting effective workflows and best practices for getting tasks accomplished on the platform. These tasks include: executing batch jobs on the platform, working with RStudio Effectively on RAP, working with Docker, decoding pheno data from raw values, and using bash effectively on RAP.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">Each of these accomplishments has stemmed from observing gaps in customer's knowledge in the platform. I believe that one of the biggest barriers to using the platform is still the feeling of impostor syndrome and I am passionate about giving customers the knowledge they need in formats that are helpful for them.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

-   <span class="c16">104 - Cloud Computing for HPC Users</span><span class="c0">. This was a course and webinar that I developed with Anastazie Sedlakova and Scott Funkhouser. It attempts to directly map skills and concepts that incoming users already have with on-premise HPC and directly translates these skills to cloud HPC. It has been rated highly by both UKB RAP users and other customers.  </span>
-   <span class="c16">312 - JSON for the DNAnexus Platform</span><span class="c0"> - This is a course that I developed that fills in a lot of the gaps with utilizing JSON effectively on the DNAnexus platform. It helps users who are unfamiliar with JSON read and modify JSON for use in applets, but also in parsing JSON responses with the platform using jq, and doing batch submissions with jq.</span>
-   <span class="c17 c16"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://laderast.github.io/bash_for_bioinformatics/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672855922035100&amp;usg=AOvVaw00ElfkpLMoJbqtGe2QUQ0M" class="c10">Bash for Bioinformatics</a></span><span class="c0"> - In response to many of the challenges that I have seen with customers and app development and running jobs, I put together a "missing manual" that addresses the gaps in knowledge of bash scripting and where this knowledge is helpful on the platform. It has gotten positive reception not only on the UKB RAP community, but also by Solution Science as a resource they can point potential customers to.  </span>
-   <span class="c16">RStudio for RAP webinar</span><span class="c0"> - With Anastazie Sedlakova, I developed a webinar that outlined how to work reproducibly with RStudio on UKB RAP. This involved not only showing users how to use RStudio Projects, but also how to save software environments for reproducible research, and run RStudio/Bioconductor via Docker containers. </span>
-   <span class="c16">Docker for RAP webinar</span><span class="c0"> - This was a webinar that I developed with Ondrej Klempir on how to effectively use Docker on UKB RAP for batch processing. It provides specific bash recipes for saving docker image files, extending docker images, and running batch jobs with Docker image files.</span>
-   <span class="c17 c16"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://laderast.github.io/dxhelper/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672855922035940&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ubVVDMAH6-sS4st76mPnu" class="c10">dxhelpe</a></span><span class="c17"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://laderast.github.io/dxhelper/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672855922036156&amp;usg=AOvVaw2UGIqxEsNfFFpR2VLb4bt7" class="c10">r</a></span><span class="c0"> - this is an R Package I have developed to help R users with decoding Pheno data extracted from the new dx extract\_dataset functionality in dx-toolkit. R users are a major percentage of UKB RAP users, and this package will helps them with their overall user experience with the pheno data.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

## <span class="c19">Improving Internal Training and Communication</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">I have helped onboard a number of our new employees through both Bootcamp and a formal set of courses. This was in direct response to Dick's call for more internal training specifically for our sales team.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

-   <span class="c16">Ongoing training with Alex Edwards</span><span class="c0">. Alex and I continue to cross-train each other on various features of the platform, including Apollo specific features. He's now ready to train OFH alpha users on these features. I hope to learn more about the ingestion process next year.</span>
-   <span class="c16">Trained 2 incoming groups on platform, including Apollo features.</span><span class="c0"> We have increased our overall training in our onboarding program, including incoming members of the Sales team. </span>

<!-- -->

-   <span class="c0">This has included frank discussions and addressing questions the Sales team has about the product, and helping them develop the language to effectively communicate about the platform. </span>
-   <span class="c0">I believe this has helped not only in increasing knowledge, but also communication between various groups at DNAnexus. </span>

<!-- -->

-   <span class="c16">Gave Science Deep Dive talk on Teaching</span>: <span class="c17"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RVuCnQy_sshmeB9Bc6s75PZJfpKOqVJ5CL_CD0KUR-E/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672855922037685&amp;usg=AOvVaw3YiJ6OHlX4UK6qJM-sQ87E" class="c10">Using Cognitive Science to Make Training Stick</a></span>
-   <span class="c16">Talk for xVantage Day: </span>Using Quarto: <span class="c17"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://laderast.github.io/qmd_rmd/%23/title-slide&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672855922038149&amp;usg=AOvVaw3T6SvPqBVHNZ3yaXRyWLm1" class="c10">https://laderast.github.io/qmd_rmd/</a></span><span class="c0"> </span>
-   <span class="c16">Trained VN team on platform</span><span class="c0">. As part of the Vietnam Team's onboarding, we delivered the Titan/Apollo courses to them.</span>
-   <span class="c16">Outreach to other groups.</span><span class="c0"> I continue to work and communicate with members of Customer Care, Translational Medicine, Customer Success, UKB RAP, and Solution Science          </span>

<span class="c0"></span>

## <span class="c19">Outreach to New Audiences</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">I want others to effectively utilize the platform and accomplish work with it. To this end, I have helped with outreach to a number of new audiences with Ben Busby and the UKB RAP team. I </span>

<span class="c0"></span>

-   <span class="c16">RAP getting started workshops.</span><span class="c0"> I sat in on 5 sessions that were a combination of workshop and Q&A for new UKB RAP users. I was actively answering questions in the chat and providing links to material.</span>
-   <span class="c16">HDR UK</span><span class="c0"> - I was part of a group of educators talking about TREs and their role in working with clinical data. Specifically I talked about the role of UKB RAP and how it fulfilled the requirements of a TRE (patient security) in spite of it being a cloud-based solution</span>
-   <span class="c16">Imaging Workshop</span><span class="c0"> - I helped Renee Qian with setup and running the MATLAB container on UKB RAP for the imaging workshop, including showing her how to use dxFUSE for her demo.</span>
-   <span class="c16">ISCB Academy</span><span class="c0"> - Ben and I presented various UKB RAP features as a workshop for ISCB Academy, and shared Bash for Bioinformatics as a resource for others.</span>
-   <span class="c16">I developed and shared an R specific workflow</span><span class="c0"> for UKB RAP for exporting, decoding, and working with Pheno data using my dxhelper package. It was used for the in-person UKB RAP workshop this December.</span>

## <span class="c19">Course Development and Innovation</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">As Academy, we continue to innovate and deliver effective training through our use of active learning exercises and other modalities. </span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">One of the ongoing challenges is training customers on the different versions of the platforms (OFH Alpha/Beta, Optum Clinico-Genomics, UKB RAP, and the GA platform). </span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">One of our goals is to integrate new features as shared by product as quickly into course materials as possible. Sometimes the material provided by product needs improvement in terms of user experience, and we aim to deliver improved notebooks so we can better teach the respective topic.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">This is a list of the courses that I have actively developed this year:</span>
