Keynote for [University of Pittburgh's Love Data Week](https://lovedatapgh.io/#keynote-address-the-value-of-compassion-in-learning-data-science). Learning data science skills effectively requires a culture of compassion and psychological safety. However, this culture is not guaranteed within academia. In this talk, I will share effective strategies for building a culture of compassion, starting with yourself, and building up a safe learning environment for others. I will highlight this with examples on my own learning and teaching journey. I will show you strategies for learning, teaching, and building an inclusive learning environment for you and your peers.
