This is a portfolio of my ongoing projects as a data scientist in training. 

Here are some example projects to check out:

- [`dplyr::slice()`](articles/slice.html) - a short article introducing the `slice()` function from the `{dplyr}` package
- [Crop Yields](articles/crops.html) - an article analyzing crop yields across the world from Tidy Tuesday.

For more info about me, please check out my [About](about.html) page.
