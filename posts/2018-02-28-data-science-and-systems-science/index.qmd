   A talk about how system science and data science are connected.   
---

I gave a talk for the Portland State University Systems Science seminar called *[How are Data Science and Systems Science Connected?](https://laderast.github.io/sysc_data_sci/)*. In this talk, I was highlighting current blind spots in Data Science that I think Systems Science approaches can address, especially that of interactions between features. I talked a little about my dissertation research (surrogate oncogenes), and the problem of *black-box interpretability* of predictive models.
