I just gave a workshop teaching the basics of [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) (the interactive web visualization framework) for a group of PDX R users. We had 10 people attend, and most of the attendees managed to get through the material and had lots of good questions. I really enjoyed talking with everyone and I hope everyone learned something. We're planning to give the workshop again to the larger PDX R user community, and some of the attendees last night have volunteered to be TAs. 

The workshop materials consist of a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/laderast/gradual_shiny) and a [Markdown document](https://laderast.github.io/gradual_shiny/) that can be done either in person or independently. The materials are freely available under an Apache 2.0 License. 

In the workshop, we build a flexible `csv` (comma separated value) explorer that can load in `csv` data files with adaptive controls and tooltips.  

In terms of packages, the workshop uses the `tidyverse` (mostly `dplyr` and `ggplot2`), and `plotly` to show some basic programming patterns in `shiny`:

1. Connecting controls to `ggplot2` aesthetics
2. Filtering data using `reactive`s
3. The `observe`/`update_` pattern
4. Tooltips (the hard way/the plotly way)
5. The final product

I'd love for more people to take a look at the workshop and would [love any suggestions](https://github.com/laderast/gradual_shiny/issues/2) for making it better!
