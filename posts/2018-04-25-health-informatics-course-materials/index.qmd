Sorry for the lack of posts. I have been busy with co-teaching our Health Informatics course (HSMP410) for the OHSU/PSU School of Public Health. 

I'm trying to make most of my lectures activity-driven for my students, who are Community Health Education and Nursing majors. I believe that you can teach mathematical concepts visually, so I am experimenting with using `LearnR`/`Shiny` to [teach the basics of data literacy](https://tladeras.shinyapps.io/dataLiteracy/). I'm also using `datacamp-light` to show my students [a simple intro to data science](http://laderast.github.io/HSMP410/week4.2/).
