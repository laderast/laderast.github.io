I'm going to be giving a talk for the PDX RLang Meetup on July 11 called "[How to Not Be Afraid of Your Data: Teaching EDA using Shiny](https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/events/240846589/)". Abstract below.

Many graduate students in the basic sciences are afraid of data exploration and cleaning, which can greatly impact their downstream analysis results. By using a synthetic dataset, some simple `dplyr` commands, and a `shiny` dashboard, we teach graduate students how to explore their data and how to handle issues that can arise (missing values, differences in units). For this talk, we'll run through a simple EDA example (combining two weight loss datasets) with a general data explorer in `shiny` that can be easily customized to teach specific EDA concepts.
