title: "Learning Data Science is Hard (and why that matters)"
---

When I gave my keynote for University of Pittsburgh's Love Data Week about being [compassionate when learning data science](https://youtu.be/za0xX10G7mU), there were a couple of great questions that came up.

1. How do we talk about learning data science for new learners?
2. How do we change our language about data science tasks so that it doesn't demotivate learners?

A lot of my thinking about this has come from my [Carpentries Instructor Training](https://preview.carpentries.org/instructor-training/08-motivation.html), but I thought I'd just talk about this in a post for others who teach Data Science, especially to new learners.

## Demotivation

For new learners to a subject need to be nutured. In particular, we have to be aware of demotivating them. 

Learning Data Science is an inherently difficult task, and it's even harder to learn when the learner is beating themselves up because they feel inadequate or don't understand what you're demonstrating. 

Think about it this way: I think all of us have had a really bad mathematics instructor who made us feel like math was not something for us. That's what we're working against. We have to let our learners know that they're not learning alone. 

## Normalize the Data Science Struggle

Again, Data Science isn't easy to learn. A lot of the Data Science tasks we do requires understanding the paradigm of tabular data, which can be a heavy lift for some learners.



## Reward Questions

Before we get started, I acknowledge two things about questions:

1. Asking questions requires courage
1. Asking questions is a way of taking care other people in your group, because they probably have that same question. 



## Avoid demotivating terms like "easy" or "just"

Why should we avoid using "easy" and "just" when we talk about data science? Such as "Oh you *just* need to do XXXX", or "YYYYY is really *easy*".

Think about those who don't get something you say is "easy". It makes them feel less than the rest of your learners who "get it".
